{"text": "This is a 54 year old woman with PMH including COPD on 2L home O2,\n   diastolic CHF with dilated RA/LA, recent PNA with PO abx regimen,\n   multiple past admissions for hypercarbic respiratory failure, also\n   morbidly obese, on home BiPAP while sleeping. Presents to ED after\n   family noticed mental status changes. Patient was found to be\n   rhoncorous bilaterally with O2 sats in 70's. Hypotensive to 80\n   systolic, 102.6 PO, c/o HA, placed on NRB and subsequently intubated,\n   with difficulty. 5L fluid given, arterial line and presep catheter\n   placed. Placed on scant amount of Levophed with SBP responding into\n   120's. ABG signficant for respiratory acidosis with signficant\n   hypercarbia, PCO2 initially 105. CXR showed RLL and LLL consolidation.\n   While in ED, received 1 gm Vancomycin, 1 gm Ceftriaxone, and 750mg\n   Levaquin. Transferred to [**Hospital Ward Name 51**] MICU for further management of PNA and\n   hypercarbia.\n   Sepsis without organ dysfunction\n   Assessment:\n   Febrile in ED, 100.4 PO upon admission to [**Hospital Ward Name 51**]. CXR showing possible\n   infiltrates. Patient with multiple hospitalizations, most recently d/c\n   from [**Hospital1 54**] on [**10-16**] after hospitalization for hypercarbic respiratory\n   failure that required MICU admission. Positive UA with >50 WBC so\n   urosepsis is a possibility. Vanc/Ceftriax/Levaquin given in ED. Was\n   initially on 0.09/mcg/kg/min Levophed however was d/c\nd almost\n   immediately after being admitted as BP was found 150\ns systolic.\n   Action:\n   UC, BC, UA, CDiff sample sent. Levofloxacin given. Standing Vanco and\n   Zosyn for broad coverage. Lactate normal.\n   Response:\n   Temp down to 98.4 PO. Remains normotensive.\n   Plan:\n   Follow lactate, CBC, f/u on culture data, re-culture prn. Levo if\n   needed for MAP > 65. Abx coverage.\n   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name **])\n   Assessment:\n   Multiple hospitalizations r/t hypercarbic respiratory failure thought\n   to be due to obesity hypoventilation syndrome. Baseline PCO2 is in\n   60\ns. PCO2 in ED initially 105, pH 7.27. Per ED, she unable to respond\n   to questions but was arousable. Subsequently intubated. Upon arrival to\n   MICU, vent settings 400/24/100%/8.\n   Action:\n   Dropped FiO2 to 50%. ABG 7.48/50/70/38.\n   Response:\n   Dropped rate to 22. Follow-up ABG:\n   Plan:\n   Serial ABG\ns, evaluate mental status for extubation, goal of baseline\n   PCO2 in 60\ns. Goal of PO2 >70.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 1, "start": 47, "end": 51, "concept": "Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease", "trigger_word": "COPD", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 1, "start": 47, "end": 51, "concept": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of horses", "trigger_word": "COPD", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 13, "end": 16, "concept": "Congestive heart failure", "trigger_word": "CHF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 3, "start": 44, "end": 63, "concept": "Respiratory Failure", "trigger_word": "respiratory failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 18, "end": 39, "concept": "Mental Status Change", "trigger_word": "mental status changes", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 15, "start": 3, "end": 9, "concept": "Sepsis", "trigger_word": "Sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 15, "start": 3, "end": 9, "concept": "Septicemia", "trigger_word": "Sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 15, "start": 18, "end": 35, "concept": "Single organ dysfunction", "trigger_word": "organ dysfunction", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 17, "start": 3, "end": 10, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "Febrile", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 34, "start": 3, "end": 22, "concept": "Respiratory Failure", "trigger_word": "Respiratory failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 36, "start": 45, "end": 64, "concept": "Respiratory Failure", "trigger_word": "respiratory failure", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 10}], "row_id": 346526, "cg_id": 16053, "caregiver": {"label": "NS", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 107, "subject_id": 3100, "hadm_id": 109932}
