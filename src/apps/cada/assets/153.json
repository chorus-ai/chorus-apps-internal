It was also accompanied by dizziness and weakness\nwhich was new for him. It was also more severe than any other\npain he has ever had, nearly bringing him to tears. No nausea,\nvomiting, or diaphoresis. It lasted 30 minutes and was relieved\nafter taking 5 tabs of nitro. He was watching television when\nthe pain began.

Attempted to wean nitro gtt\nthe evening of admission and CP began to recur at level of [**2-3**]\nwhen nitro drip stopped and resolved when it was restarted.\nGiven his initial chest pain and given the patient's extensive\ncardiac history, plan was to go for cath on [**2178-3-23**], which\nshowed stenosis of the RCA graft.  The RCA was balooned and\nstented and during the procedure the patient complainted of\n[**11-4**] chest pain.  It is likely that a clot had embolized and\nwent downstream during the stenting procedured.  Subsequently,\nthe patient cardiac enzymes started to rise and peaked at\nCK-796, CK-MB->84 and trop at 2.85. EKG showed ST elevations in\ninferior leads. The next day nitro drip was stopped and the\npatient was started on his home dose ranolazine and stared on\nimdur 60mg, and remained chest pain free. Back on the floor, he\nwas uptitrated to imdur 180 daily, and had no more chest pain or\ndiscomfort.\n.\n# anemia: Hct stable near 29 on admission.
