{"text": "63 year old woman with lupus, obesity, prior thyroid lymphoma with\n   resultant hypothyroidism who was found down at her home- noted to be\n   bradycardic and hypotensive by EMS, unable to transcutaneously pace in\n   the field.  In the ED at [**Hospital3 3191**] Hospital she continued to be\n   bradycardic, in complete heart block by report, she was coded for\n   bradycardia HR 20s rec'd epi/ atropine/ glucagon/ etc.  A temporary\n   transvenous pacing wire was placed.  She was intubated, started on\n   dopamine and propofol and transferred here for further care.  She is in\n   a hard collar r/t unwitnessed fall, CT head at OSH pnd.  ECHO at OSH\n   PND. Unclear etiology of CHB.\n   Heart block, complete (CHB)\n   Assessment:\n   R SC transvenous pacing wire remains in place. No ectopy noted. No\n   pacing noted. HR 80\ns-100s NSR/ST.\n   Action:\n   *Transvenous pacer tested per [**Hospital1 1**] protocol- see Metavision for\n   settings. Magnesium/ Phosphate repleted. EKG obtained.\n   *Permanent PCM on hold given fevers overnight per EP\n   Response:\n   Remains in NSR/ST without bradycardia or rhythm disturbance noted.\n   Plan:\n   *Permanent PCM once afebrile. Keep temporary wire in place until\n   permanent PCM. Monitor per hosp policy.\n   Hypotension (not Shock)\n   Assessment:\n   Received Pt. on IV Dopamine at 12mcg/kg/min with BP ranges initially\n   90-100\ns/40-50. CVP 10.  UOP ~50ml/hr, increasing after doses of IV\n   anbx.  Weak palp radial pulses and weak palp DP/PT.Skin cool/ clammy.\n   Action:\n   *Completed 2^nd liter of IVF per order.\n   *Unclear etiology of hypotension- sepsis vs cardiogenic. PA line placed\n   over wire (R IJ TLC) under fluoroscopy at 17:00. CVP 10. PCWP 22,\n   correlating w/ PAD 22.  MVO2 68. HGB/ CO/CI numbers PND.\n   *Weaned dopamine as able\n   *ECHO complete->\n   *Minimizing hypotensive effect of propofol by adding midazolam. (See\n   below for pain control).\n   *Pt s/p multiple failed attempts at arterial line [**4-10**]. Following NIBPs.\n   Response:\n   *Pt w/ BP 90s-100s, MAPs high 50s-60s on dopamine @ 8mcg/kg/min.  PADs\n   low 20s.\n   Plan:\n   Awaiting team plans given new PA line data. Awaiting CO/CI.   Continue\n   to wean dopamine as able. Follow fluid/ volume status/ UOP. Monitor for\n   s/s sepsis/ temp spike.\n   Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, not Fever of Unknown Origin)\n   Assessment:\n   Tmax-> 100.4 blood. WBC up slightly 11.2 (10.9). Pan cultured overnight\n   last night.  Pt diaphoretic/ clammy. Lactate 2.0. VS as above.\n   Action:\n   *Triple IV anbx- cefepime/ vanco/ flagyl.\n   *Monitored temp/ WBC\n   *Tylenol PRN\n had been given via NGT, however, later found that\n   gastric meds not being absorbed.\n   *Cool baths/ skin care PRN for diaphoresis\n   Response:\n   T range 99.8-100.4 Rectal/ blood.\n   Plan:\n   Cont to monitor temp (now w/ blood temp monitor on PA line), follow up\n   with cultures., Antibxs as ordered\n   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])\n   Assessment:\n   *Rec\nd pt on AC FiO2 50%, 500 x 20, 5 peep.\n   *LS clear apices/ rhonchi throughout. SPO2 >94%. Thick, tan secretions\n   via ETT. Sedated per below.\n   Action:\n   *Likely aspiration pneumonitis from brady event per team, anbx as above\n   *Weaned vent settings: PS trial 12PS/ 5 peep-> RR up to 40s, pt\n   appearing uncomfortable in bed.  PS increased to 16/ 5 peep. VENOUS\n   blood gas correlating to ABG on AC settings per resp. Stayed on these\n   settings most of the day. Placed on AC, fiO2 100% for PA line\n   placement.\n   Response:\n   *After line placed, FiO2 decreased to 50%. VBG pnd.\n   Plan:\n   Cont to monitor resp status, CXR in am, cont IV Antibxs as ordered.\n   Follow VBGs until arterial line able to be placed.\n   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)\n   Assessment:\n   Action:\n   Response:\n   Plan:\n   Cont to monitor pain, may need pain consult to aid in best\n   sedation/pain medications, cont to monitor neuro status, comfort and\n   emotional support to Pt. and husband\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 19, "start": 32, "end": 38, "concept": "Fever", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0015967", "trigger_word": "fevers", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 30, "start": 10, "end": 14, "concept": "Weakness", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C3714552", "trigger_word": "Weak", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 33, "start": 37, "end": 43, "concept": "Sepsis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0243026", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 33, "start": 37, "end": 43, "concept": "Septicemia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0036690", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 39, "start": 13, "end": 17, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 47, "start": 7, "end": 13, "concept": "Sepsis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0243026", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 47, "start": 7, "end": 13, "concept": "Septicemia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0036690", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 48, "start": 3, "end": 8, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "Fever", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 48, "start": 37, "end": 60, "concept": "Fever of Unknown Origin", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0015970", "trigger_word": "Fever of Unknown Origin", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 64, "start": 3, "end": 22, "concept": "Respiratory Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1145670", "trigger_word": "Respiratory failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 74, "start": 35, "end": 37, "concept": "Actinic cheilitis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0267026", "trigger_word": "AC", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 75, "start": 39, "end": 41, "concept": "Actinic cheilitis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0267026", "trigger_word": "AC", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 82, "start": 17, "end": 27, "concept": "Acute onset pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0184567", "trigger_word": "acute pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 82, "start": 29, "end": 41, "concept": "Chronic pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0150055", "trigger_word": "chronic pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 13}, {"num_sents": 87, "start": 19, "end": 23, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 14}, {"num_sents": 88, "start": 12, "end": 16, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 3, "concept_id": 15}], "row_id": 629067, "cg_id": 19062, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 149, "subject_id": 76514, "hadm_id": 125586}
