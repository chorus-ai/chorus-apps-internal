{"text": "39 y/o M with ETOH abuse who presented on [**3-18**] with lactic acidosis and\n   profound weakness. He was found to be severely thiamine deficient\n   consistent with a diagnosis of Beri Beri.  Pt was repleted aggressively\n   with Thiamine, MIV and had an NG placed for nutrition.  He developed\n   re-feeding syndrome requiring aggressive electrolyte repletion.  He\n   developed ETOH withdrawal and mental status changes approximately\n   24-48hr after admission.  He was treated with small doses of Valium and\n   mental status improved somewhat before he was called out to medicine on\n   [**3-21**].\n    On [**3-23**], he was advanced a dysphagia diet and the following day, he\n   spiked a fever to 101.8.  Initial infectious work up revealed negative\n   UA, neg Blood Cx, negative Cdiff and possible infiltrate on CXR. Chest\n   CT revealed bilateral pleural effusions and atelectasis.\n   He triggered on [**2191-3-24**] for tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoxia.  His\n   hypoxia resolved, and CTA was subsequently negative for PE.  Mental\n   status further deteriorated after fevers began and there was concern\n   for intermittent seizures due to bilateral upper extremity tremors and\n   periodic eye deviation.  2mg Ativan given without significant\n   improvement.  Pt was loaded with Keppra 1gram, started on Acyclovir\n   700mg IV TID and Keppra 1500mg [**Hospital1 7**].  Neuro attending recommended\n   transfer to MICU for continuous EEG monitoring.\n   Upon arrival to MICU, he was transported pt to head ct which was + for\n   small 4 mm subdural. Throughout the night, ? r/t keppra dosing pt\n   became more somnulent, acidotic and o2 dependent. He was intubated then\n   ([**3-26**]) for airway protection.\n   .H/O airway, Inability to Protect (Risk for Aspiration, Altered Gag,\n   Airway Clearance, Cough)\n   Assessment:\n   Suctioning ETT for scant white sputum.
