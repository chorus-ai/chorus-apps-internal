At OSH, found to be\nin CHB and is s/p temporary pacing wire placement. According to\nwife, patient has had progressive DOE over the past few weeks.\nHe has also had increased LE edema recently. No known complaints\nof chest pain. He returned home after coaching a baseball game\ntoday and collapsed. He was found to be pulseless. A neighbor\nwho is an [**Name (NI) 9168**] was called, and began administering CPR. EMS\narrived ~15min later and found pt to be in VF. One shock was\nadministered and he returned to sinus rhythm. He was nasally\nintubated in the field. En route, he was found to be\nprogressively bradycardic, and his rhythm was c/w CHB. He was\ntaken to [**Hospital 487**] Hospital and a temporary pacing wire was\nplaced through the R IJ (apparently done under unsterile\nconditions). He was changed to oral intubation. He received IV\nmetoprolol, NTG gtt, atropine, and Versed. Bedside TTE showed EF\n30-35% with anterio AK, 2+ TR, 2+ MR. CK was 337 with negative\ntroponin T. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.\n\n.\nOn presentation to the [**Hospital1 18**] ED, he was intubated and sedated,\nwith the temporary pacer appropriately capturing. He was\nminimally responsive, on sedation, on admission. he was given\ngentamicin, metronidazole, and cefazolin for his unsterile pacer\nwire. Head CT was done to r/o bleed [**1-14**] fall and\nanticoagulation. He was admitted to the CCU for further\nmonitoring.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\n1.

There is mild congestive heart failure with\ncardiomegaly. Note is made of opacity in the left lower lobe\nindicating aspiration. There is no evidence of pneumothorax.\n.\nCT head: no ICH, ethmoid sinusitis, no fracture\n.\nTTE ([**1-17**]): The left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild\nsymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size\nand systolic function (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size\nand free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly\ndilated. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. A\nbioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The\ntransaortic gradient is normal for this prosthesis. The aortic\nprosthesis leaflets are not well seen. Mild to moderate valvular\n([**12-14**]+) aortic regurgitation is seen. No paravalvular leak is\nseen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+)\nmitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery\nsystolic pressure is normal. There is a physiologic pericardial\neffusion.\n.\nCath ([**2165**]): 1. Normal coronary arteries.\n2. Normal ventricular function.\n3. Severe aortic stenosis.\n\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\n.\n# Cardiac arrest: On admission, it was reported that he had a VF\narrest by EMS, and converted with 1 shock in the field.  EP,\nhowever, felt his cardiac arrest was more likely secondary to\npolymorphic VT as a result of his prolonged QT and complete\nheart block.  He had no CAD on cath so it was likely not\nischemic in etiology.  Despite the suspicion for polymorphic VT,\nEP felt primary VF could not be ruled out, so an ICD was placed\non [**3-12**].\n.\n# Complete heart block:  He had a temporary pacing wire placed\nat the outside hospital, and was V-paced at 60bpm.  His native\nheart rate was less than 30.  The etiology of his complete heart\nblock was thought to be secondary to degenerative conduction\ndisease, as he seems to have had progressive conduction\nabnormalities per past EKGs.  Viral myocarditis was also\nconsidered a possibility as his family gave a history of\nflu-like symptoms a few days before his cardiac arrest.  His TSH\nwas normal and his cath was clean.  A dual chamber ICD was\nplaced on [**3-12**].  He was maintained on a beta blocker for rate\ncontrol as his rate was in the 90s after his dual chamber ICD\nwas placed.  He developed a hematoma from his ICD site,\ninvolving his left shoulder and inner arm.  His heparin drip was\ndiscontinued, and his hematoma resolved into an ecchymosis that\nhas been stable.  He has an appointment in device clinic for\ninterrogation of his ICD the day after discharge.  He will\nfollow up this and his other cardiac issues with his\ncardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 120**].\n.\n# AVR: He is on Coumadin as an inpatient for his mechanical\naortic valve.  He received vitamin K 5mg po on [**3-9**] to reverse\nhis INR in preparation for his ICD placement.  IV heparin was\nrestarted s/p ICD placement.  His mechanical aortic valve was\nfound to be functioning well on TTE.  He was restarted on\nCoumadin, and his INR was therapeutic for a few days before\nadmission.  He was discharged on Coumadin 5mg po daily with the\nplan to get her INR checked 4 days after discharge.  He will\nresume management of his anticoagulation with his PCP.\n.\n# Anoxic encephalopathy:  According to the family, there was an\napproximate 5-minute lapse between his collapse at home and\ninitiation of CPR.  He was initially minimally responsive when\nintubated, even with lightening of sedation.  His CT head showed\nno intracranial hemorrhage.  Fortunately, he began to recover\nsome cortical function within 48 hours of his cardiac arrest,\nand began to follow commands.  Upon extubation and\ndiscontinuation of his sedation, he was disoriented and became\nagitated, responding well to olanzapine.  He was maintained on\nolanzapine for a couple of days, and his agitation resolved.  He\nalso seemed to have some motor difficulty with impaired hand-eye\ncoordination, as well as some short-term memory deficit.  His\ncognitive and motor deficits are likely due to anoxic\nencephalopathy.  He has experienced rapid improvement while in\nthe hospital.  He was evaluated by Occupational Therapy and\nPhysical Therapy, and felt to be safe to be discharged home.  He\nwill follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of Behavioral\nNeurology in 6 weeks for reassessment.\n.\n# Respiratory status:  He was initially intubated for airway\nprotection during cardiac arrest.  He had mild pulmonary edema\non chest x-ray, for which he received IV Lasix for diuresis.  He\nwas weaned from the ventilator over the next couple of days, and\nwas extubated on [**3-13**].  He had a possible infiltrate on chest\nx-ray and a leukocytosis, so he received a 7-day course of\nlevofloxacin and vancomycin for empiric treatment of VAP.  He\nwas weaned off oxygen and had good sats with ambulation upon\ndischarge.\n.\n# CAD: No CAD on cath.  He was continued on aspirin and his\noutpatient dose of statin.\n.\n# CHF: He likely has diastolic dysfunction with his aortic\nstenosis and hypertension.  His TTE showed an EF of 60%.  His\nCHF symptoms were possibly due to progressive bradycardia and\ncomplete heart block.  He was volume overloaded on admission.\nHe diuresed well on IV Lasix, and was euvolemic for several days\nbefore discharge.  He was maintained on a BB and ACE-inhibitor.\n.\n# DM2:  His blood sugars were initially well-controlled on\nsliding scale insulin, but he had poor po intake.  He was\nrestarted on his metformin after he resumed his diet.\n.\n# Leukocytosis:  His initial leukocytosis was felt to be\nsecondary to a possible ventilator-associated pneumonia.  He was\ninitially treated with ceftriaxone and vancomycin.  Ceftriaxone\nwas discontinued for a possible drug rash.  He was switched to\nlevofloxacin and maintained on vancomycin, and completed a 7-day\ncourse of antibiotics.  His leukocytosis resolved initially, but\nthen recurred, while still on antibiotics.  He had no localizing\nsymptoms, a clear chest x-ray, and negative UA and culture.  As\nthe origin for the elevated WBC count could not be identified,\nhis antibiotics were discontinued at the end of his 7-day course\nfor VAP.  He was discharged to PCP follow up, with a check of\nhis WBC count in 4 days after discharge.\n.\n# FEN:  After extubation, he had a video swallow evaluation that\nshowed aspiration of a regular diet.  He was found to tolerate\nground solids and thin liquids with careful swallowing and\nstrict aspiration precautions.  He was discharged home on this\ndiet.  Speech and Swallow recommended repeat video swallow\nevaluation in 2 weeks to reassess his aspiration risk, and\nhopefully clear him for regular diet.\n.\n# Code status: FULL CODE.\n.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nAtenolol 100mg qd\nCoumadin\nLipitor 20mg qd\nMetformin 1000mg [**Hospital1 **]\nTricor 48mg qd\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
