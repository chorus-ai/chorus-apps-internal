CKMB 58\n   & troponin 0.03.  Dopamine started for pressures in the 70s systolic.\n   RIJ dialysis cath placed and pt emergently dialyzed.  Post dialysis K+\n   8.0.  Pt also rec\nd 1gram vanco & 3.375grams of zosyn. Pt transferred\n   to [**Hospital1 19**] MICU.\n   Events\n pt receiving CRRT for hyperkalemia and renal failure. System\n   clotted within 1\n hrs of onset. Second system taken down within 3 hrs\n   of initiation due to ? defect in machine. Attending aware that if\n   system went down it would not be restarted as pts renal failure is\n   improving. OGT inserted, xray taken to confirm placement.
