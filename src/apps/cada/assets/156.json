Nursing home records indicated that\nthe patient was short of breath and found to be highly congested\nwith decreased oxygen sats and crackles. A stat CXR was ordered\nby the PA. The attending came in today and noted the patient was\nunresponsive in bed so he was referred to the ED for further\nmanagament. He is typically oriented only to self but can report\nif he is in pain.\n\nHe was recently admitted for acute on chornic systolic CHF\nexacerbation and was concomitantly treated for [**Hospital3 **]\npneumonia with vanco/zosyn then levofloxacin for a total course\nof 3 days. Antibiotics were stopped prior discharge.\n\nPer EMS patient had a recent pneumonia also has a history of CHF\nthey were called for respiratory distress. EMS reported that the\npatient was full code.\nUpon arrival to the ED, he was on positive pressure ventilation\nwith sats in the low 90's. He was unable to speak secondary to\nrespiratory distress and appeared as if he was tiring. Noted to\nhave bibasilar rales. As a result he was easily intubated with a\n7.5 ETT with etomidate and succinylcholine. He was sedated with\nfentanyl and midazolam. He was tachycardic to the 130s and had a\nblood pressure in the systolics of 60, so norepinephrine was\nstarted. Paperwork was then faxed over that noted the patient is\nDNR/DNI. A left IJ was attempted but the line went laterally. A\nright IJ placed into the cavoatrial junction. He was given a\ntotal of 6L NS. His UA returned positive. He also has a 20G in\nhis right hand. He was given vanco/zosyn. EKG was concerning for\na ST elevation in lead 3, in the context of a LBBB. Cardiology\nwas consulted and felt that these changes were likely a result\nof sepsis with demand ischmia as these changes improved with\nimproved hemodynamics. They recommended serial trops, Echo, and\naspirin with heparin if no evidence of DIC.\n\nOn arrival to the MICU, he is intubated and unresponsive.\n\nPast Medical History:\n- Coronary artery disease (stenting of D1 in [**7-/2191**])\n- Congestive heart failure (EF 30% as of [**8-/2199**])\n- Ischemic cardiomyopathy\n- Cerebrovascular accident ([**2187**])\n- Hypertension\n- Recurrent [**Year (4 digits) **] PNA\n- Depression\n- GERD\n- Neurogenic bladder\n- Gout\n- BPH\n\nSocial History:\n[**Year (4 digits) 595**] speaking only.

He\nwas admitted to the MICU intubated with hemodynamic instability\nrequiring norepi/vasopressin and IVF.  While a broad workup was\npursued, this was most likely felt to be sepsis given his fever,\nleukocytosis, positive UA and purulent sputum.  He was covered\nwith vanco/cefepime/cipro for HCAP and urinary sources.  He was\nalso empirically started on a heparin drip for PE and in the\nsetting of elevated troponins given his rapid decompensation.\nLENI's were ordered but were not completed prior to his passing.\n Troponins and serial EKGs were performed.  He was started on a\nstatin, continued on plavix, and not on aspirin secondary to\nallergy.  His BB and ACE were held given his hypotension.  His\nCXR also revealed an element of volume overload in the setting\nof a hx of CHF.  He was sedated given dysynchrony on the vent\nand his PEEP was uptitrated.  His course was further complicated\nby hypernatremia thought to be secondary to poor free water\nintake as an outpatient, and [**Last Name (un) **] also thought to be secondary to\ndehydration.  His coags uptrended which was concerning for DIC,\nbut his fibrinogen was normal.  Despite all of the aggressive\nmeasures listed above, he became more hypotensive with\nsubsequent bradycardia.  As he was initially intubated in the\nsetting of DNR/DNI order, chest compressions were not started\nand the patient expired.  His guardian, wife and son were all\ncalled multiple times and messages were left regarding his\ndecompensation and tenuous state.  Mr. [**Known lastname 7838**] son arrived just\nminutes after his father's passing.  Culture data that resulted\nafter the patient expired revealed an oxacillin sensitive staph\naureus in both the sputum and the blood.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nMedications HOME: (per NSH records)\n1.
