{"text": "Mr. [**Known lastname 6949**] is a 51 year-old man with a history of chronic hypercapneic\n   respiratory failure s/p trach, COPD, and morbid obesity who presented\n   from [**Hospital **] Rehab with hypotension  to 70\ns,altered mental  status and\n   is admitted to the MICU for further management.\n   He was trached on [**2178-8-13**] and last discharged on [**2178-9-18**] for\n   hypercapneic respiratory failure which was thought to be secondary to a\n   cuff leak, though he was also treated for resistant psuedomonas VAP\n   during this admission.  He went to [**Hospital **] rehab and completed a course\n   of tobramycin (last dose ?[**2178-9-19**]).  He also had blood cx that grew\n   coag negative staph and was started on vanc on [**9-27**].  He had a\n   leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 16 that trended down to 6 on the day\n   of admission.  A urine cx grew ESBL klebsiella on [**9-30**] but he was not\n   started on antibiotics for this for unclear reasons.  During this time,\n   his metoprolol was also increased from 12.5 mg po tid to 25 mg po tid\n   on [**9-27**] for improved a. fib heart rate control.\n   .\n   On the day of admission, he was found to have a BP of 85/65 -> 60/palp\n   from a baseline in the low 100s systolic after debridement of a right\n   flank wound.  He was thought to be bacteremic and given approximately\n   1L IVF bolus with no response.  He was then transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] for\n   further management.\n   .\n   On arrival, VS were 97.8 84 80/47 24 100% on unknown vent settings.  He\n   was thought to be septic vs having beta blocker toxicity (last\n   metoprolol given at 2 p.m.) and was given zosyn, 800cc L IVF, and\n   glucagon, with improvement in SBP to 120 transiently after the\n   glucagon.  Toxicology was consulted and felt that beta blocker toxicity\n   was unlikely given absence of bradycardia.\n   .\n   A right radial a-line and left femoral line were placed for access.  A\n   CXR was performed and demonstrated infiltrate vs overload.  IVFs were\n   held after the CXR, and he was started on levophed.  Per report, a\n   bedside ECHO was also performed to eval for tamponade but was limited\n   secondary to body habitus.\n   .\n   On the floor, he was minimally responsive to verbal stimuli and began\n   having rhythmic, tooth clattering motions at the chin.  He was given 1\n   mg IV ativan x 2 with resolution.\n   Respiratory failure, chronic\n   Assessment:\n   Pt chronicle on vent, cont  AC , LS rhoncis, sat 96%,suctin moderate\n   amount yellow thick secretion,\n   Action:\n   Multiple vent changes done to keep PCO2 70, several ABG sent.

Acute hypotension is likely related to\n   sepsis given coag neg staph in blood cultures and ESBL klebsiella in\n   urine culture, which was not yet treated.
