{"text": "70M with TBI and CVA with trach, history of recurrent PNA, UTI and\n   sepsis who presented to [**Hospital 880**] Hospital on [**2-27**] with fever, hypoxia,\n   hypercarbia, hypotension from [**Hospital1 **].  At [**Hospital1 **] febrile to 102\n   and concern from trach leak.  En route to [**Hospital1 19**] was found to be\n   unstable and re-routed to [**Hospital 880**] Hospital.  At [**Hospital 880**] Hospital\n   treated for presumed VAP and multiple open skin ulcers, CXR showing\n   consildation and labs revealing MRSA bacteremia, MRSA and pseudomonas\n   PNA, MRSA/klebisiella UTI.  Trach changed from Shiley to Bovina.  At\n   [**Hospital1 880**] had ARF (pt has CRI) likely secondary to hypovolemia, BUN/Cr\n   continued to rise despite interventions. Renal service at [**Hospital 880**]\n   Hospital did not feel pt was candidate for HD, sent to [**Hospital1 19**] for second\n   opinion.\n   CODE: FULL\n   Allergies:  gabapentin, plavix, meclizine, olanzapine, tobramycin,\n   meropenum\n   Precautions: MRSA/VRE/CDIFF\n   Gastrointestinal bleed, upper (Melena, GI Bleed, GIB)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt with HCT trending down since admission to OSH.  Upon arrival OGT\n   with dark red [**Last Name (LF) 573**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] tube clear, stool golden brown in color, will\n   guiac with bag change.\n   Action:\n   OGT hooked up to [**Last Name (LF) 14215**], [**First Name3 (LF) **] tube residuals checked q4h, HCT checked upon\n   arrival to unit, type and cross sent with AM labs.  Started on PPI.\n   Response:\n   OGT draining approx 400cc coffee ground fluid, HO aware, HCT up\n   slightly from OSH (21 to 23).\n   Plan:\n   Trend HCT, monitor for signs of active bleeding, continue to assess\n   OGT/[**First Name3 (LF) **] residuals.  Team to discuss plan during rounds.\n   Bacteremia\n   Assessment:\n   Pt with MRSA bacteremia, MRSA/pseudomonas PNA, and MRSA/klebsiella\n   UTI.  Pt\ns vital signs stable upon arrival, HR AFIB 90-100s with\n   episodes of SVT to 130-140, NIBP 90s, trending to 80s then high 70s.\n   Pt hypothermic at 94 degrees.\n   Action:\n   One set [**First Name3 (LF) 573**] culture sent from CVL, unable to send second set due to\n   poor skin integrity.  Received one tide dose vanco and started on\n   standing dose [**Hospital1 7**]. Received 500cc bolus x 2 for NBP 70s.  Sputum\n   culture also sent, unable to send urine due to poor urine output.  Bair\n   hugger placed for low temp.\n   Response:\n   No response from IVF boluses, remained in mid 80s therefore started on\n   levophed drip to maintain SBP >90.  Sputum and [**Hospital1 573**] culture pending.\n   Temp trending upward.\n   Plan:\n   Continue IV ABX, team to discuss this morning broadening coverage,\n   trend WBC and temp curve, levophed for SBP >90, follow up culture\n   data.\n   Respiratory failure, chronic\n   Assessment:\n   Received pt with [**Last Name (un) **] trach in place, + cuff leak, vent settings\n   40%/400*20/+5, pt overbreathing vent by 3-6 breaths, STV 400-500, MV\n   [**8-22**], lung sounds rhonchorous throughout.  Pt desatting to low 90s upon\n   admission after being turned for evaluation of wounds.\n   Action:\n   FiO2 increased to 60%, suctioned for small to moderate amount of thick,\n   pink secretions, specimen sent for culture.  Trach leak variable with\n   pt positioning.\n   Response:\n   Sats to high 90s on 60%, no change in lung sounds post suctioning,\n   sputum culture pending.\n   Plan:\n   Continue aggressive pulmonary toilet, wean vent support as tolerated by\n   pt to pt\ns baseline vent settings as pt is chronically vented.\n   Impaired Skin Integrity\n   Assessment:\n   Pt with multiple skin impairments and pressure ulcers, locations\n   include bilateral earlobes, trach site, bilateral scapulae, lower back,\n   coccyx, bilateral ischium, bilateral arms and both feet.  All in\n   various stages of healing.  Please see skin impairment section of\n   MetaVision for detailed description of each pressure ulcer.\n   Action:\n   Upon arrival all wound dressings taken down and assessed.  Mepilex\n   placed on most open areas, more severe ulcers requiring wet to dry\n   dressings.  Wound care consult placed.  Placed on air mattress.  HO in\n   to evaluate.\n   Response:\n   No change in skin impairments since admission.\n   Plan:\n   Pt needs formal wound care consult, frequent turns, dressings as\n   needed.\n   Renal failure, Chronic (Chronic renal failure, CRF, Chronic kidney\n   disease)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt sent from [**Hospital 880**] Hospital where pt was deemed not HD candidate by\n   their renal service.  Pt has foley but is essentially anuric, total\n   urine output this shift 10cc.  Urine cloudy and yellow with sludge.\n   Unable to send urine for analysis or for culture.\n   Action:\n   Renal team consulted for ? HD, BUN/Cr checked with AM labs.\n   Response:\n   BUN/Cr down slightly from admission.\n   Plan:\n   Renal team to consult today, monitor UOP, trend BUN/Cr.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 1, "start": 17, "end": 20, "concept": "Cerebrovascular accident", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0038454", "trigger_word": "CVA", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 1, "start": 59, "end": 62, "concept": "Urinary tract infection", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0042029", "trigger_word": "UTI", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 3, "end": 9, "concept": "Sepsis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0243026", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 3, "end": 9, "concept": "Septicemia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0036690", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 74, "end": 79, "concept": "Fever", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0015967", "trigger_word": "fever", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 3, "start": 72, "end": 79, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "febrile", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 8, "start": 25, "end": 28, "concept": "Urinary tract infection", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0042029", "trigger_word": "UTI", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 9, "start": 27, "end": 30, "concept": "Rheumatic Fever", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035436", "trigger_word": "ARF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 31, "start": 3, "end": 13, "concept": "Bacteremia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0004610", "trigger_word": "Bacteremia", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 34, "start": 3, "end": 6, "concept": "Urinary tract infection", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0042029", "trigger_word": "UTI", "occ": 3, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 35, "start": 38, "end": 42, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0004238", "trigger_word": "AFIB", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 52, "start": 3, "end": 22, "concept": "Respiratory Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1145670", "trigger_word": "Respiratory failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 86, "start": 3, "end": 16, "concept": "Kidney Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035078", "trigger_word": "Renal failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 86, "start": 50, "end": 53, "concept": "Cancer-related fatigue", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C4274302", "trigger_word": "CRF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 13}, {"num_sents": 87, "start": 3, "end": 10, "concept": "Disease", "trigger_word": "disease", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 14}], "row_id": 529623, "cg_id": 20871, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 46, "subject_id": 46105, "hadm_id": 126246}
