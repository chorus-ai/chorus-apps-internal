{"text": "CCU Nursing Progress Note\n   (7p-7a)\n   This is a 43 yr old with h/o anterior MI\n[**92**], ischemic dilated CM, EF\n   20% presents with firing of AICD several times at home and s/p\npassing\n   out\n at home at 1p and then feeling firing of ICD at 6p. He was\n   admitted to [**Hospital1 54**] via ER for these events on day of admission.\n   [**9-20**]- Pt was sent to EP  for VT ablation, c/b PEA arrest.( ? possible\n   clot/PE). Procedure aborted and pt coded- reportedly CPR x 30 minutes.\n   Pt vented, sedated and IABP. Noted to have distended abdomen- (+)\n   pancreatic by lab results. NPO/ OGT to intermittent sx.\n   [**9-21**] Pressors then IABP weaned and d/c\nd. Sheath pulled late afternoon\n   w small hematoma- Pt remains sedated on propofol, unable to determine\n   CIWA scale. ECHO revealing EF- 20% w large mural thrombus. Pt scheduled\n   and sent to CT to r/o thrombus/emboli to head- preliminary results (-).\n   Hemodynamics WNL off pressors/IABP.\n   [**9-22**]-Given valium 5mg po this morning( for CIWA/ possible withdrawal\n   ETOH) while weaning propofol after discussion with CCU team. Propofol\n   off since 130pm\n pt only opening eyes but not blinking\nto threat\n   focusing or tracking. No movement of arms or legs. Pt remains on PS 5/5\n   40%. Pt not extubated  due to poor mental status.  Temp spike 101\n pan\n   cultured. Started on Vanco/Zosyn for (+) sputum/urine results. Several\n   episodic NSVT on evenings and one longer run at rate 220\ns which\n   resulted in self firing of ICD successfully out of tachyrhythym. Given\n   15 mg IV lopressor and increased PO dose. Plan is to start AMIO IV per\n   EP fellow if continues to have further VT runs. To obtain neuro consult\n   in AM if mental status remains unchanged/ and  if pt does not wake up\n   significantly.\n   Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, not Fever of Unknown Origin)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt admitted s/p PEA arrest/ requiring intubation/code- currently\n   spiking temps w (+) sputum/urine specimens\n   Action:\n   Pt pan cultured earlier Wed- sent additional sputum/urine to clarify\n   questionable findings/fine tune antibx coverage. Started on\n   vanco/zosyn. Tylenol started prn as well.\n   Response:\n   T max- 99.4-8. No fever this shift. Given tylenol x 2 doses. 2^nd\n   sputum/urine specimen pending.\n   Plan:\n   Continue antibx as ordered. Keep afebrile w tylenol as needed. Await\n   further info from cultures already sent to lab.\n   .H/O alcohol abuse\n   Assessment:\n   Pt admitted to [**Hospital1 54**] for EPS- reportedly s/p large ETOH ingestion\n   Saturday, unknown Sunday\ns consumption. Currently on CIWA scale to\n   assess more closely. Pt off all sedation but remains not alert/awake\n   enough to follow commands, thus requiring continuation of intubation\n   for airway protection.\n   Action:\n   CIWA scale observed. Valium IV PRN ordered. No valium given d/t current\n   level of sedation/ no sz activity visible, no evidence of ETOH\n   withdrawal. Remains without purposeful response or following commands\n   off all sedation.\n   Of note- pt is s/p CT scan [**9-22**] nite to r/o embolic event to head in\n   setting of known large CV clot by ECHO- by report results were (-).\n   Response:\n   See above- no evidence of ETOH withdrawal currently. No benzo\ns given\n   this shift.\n   Plan:\n   Continue to closely observe for ETOH withdrawal. Plan to consult neuro\n   today to better assess neuro status s/p CPR/Code/PEA arrest in pt that\n   is not fully waking up s/p d/c of all sedation.\n   Ventricular tachycardia, non-sustained (NSVT)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt s/p several episodes of VT/ICD firing- admitted to [**Hospital1 **] via ER for\n   EPS. Pt developing PEA arrest during study/resulting in\n   code/intubation/pressors/IABP.\n   Action:\n   Pt\ns hemodynamics remain stable off all pressors/IABP. Issue this shift\n   of pt developing runs of NSVT.  ICD firing x 1 this shift, when rate >\n   200 for moderately long run( see strips). Pt has had episodic NS runs\n   VT 4-8 beats without further firing of ICD, spontaneously converting\n   back to ST. Given 15 mg total IVP lopressor, remains on lopressor tid.\n   Given AM dose early per HO. Checked AM lytes early . given tylenol in\n   attempts to bring down HR as well , in spite of pt being low grade, not\n   febrile this shift.\n   Response:\n   See above. No further sustained runs VT or firing of ICD this shift.\n   Lytes all WNL currently.\n   Plan:\n   Continue to follow closely- discuss plan w EP re: restarting AMIO\n   gtt/bolus( had been on s/p PEA code in EP lab transiently). Continue to\n   closely follow for any further firing- appropriate or inappropriate- of\n   ICD.\n   Keep lytes WNL. Keep family aware of plan of care/current progress.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 20, "start": 67, "end": 77, "concept": "Withdrawal (dysfunction)", "trigger_word": "withdrawal", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 36, "start": 3, "end": 8, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "Fever", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 36, "start": 37, "end": 60, "concept": "Fever of Unknown Origin", "trigger_word": "Fever of Unknown Origin", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 45, "start": 21, "end": 26, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "fever", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 50, "start": 8, "end": 21, "concept": "Alcohol abuse", "trigger_word": "alcohol abuse", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 60, "start": 25, "end": 27, "concept": "Seizures", "trigger_word": "sz", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 61, "start": 3, "end": 13, "concept": "Withdrawal (dysfunction)", "trigger_word": "withdrawal", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 66, "start": 34, "end": 44, "concept": "Withdrawal (dysfunction)", "trigger_word": "withdrawal", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 70, "start": 40, "end": 50, "concept": "Withdrawal (dysfunction)", "trigger_word": "withdrawal", "occ": 3, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 82, "start": 65, "end": 67, "concept": "Nuclear non-senile cataract", "trigger_word": "NS", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 87, "start": 3, "end": 10, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "febrile", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}], "row_id": 390912, "cg_id": 15023, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 147, "subject_id": 17539, "hadm_id": 153621}
