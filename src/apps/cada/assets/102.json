{"text": "The pt ia an unfortunate 80yo man with multiple medical problems who\n   initially presented to an osh on [**9-12**] with noted weakness and a\n   presumed aspiration pnx. A head ct revealed a hemorrhagic cva at the\n   site of a known brain tumor. He now has left sided hemiparesis and his\n   medical course at the osh has been complicated by multiple pnxs and an\n   inability to wean from ventilatory support. His care has been further\n   complicated by a h/o mds for which he is chronically anemic and\n   thrombocytopenic. The pt has required nearly daily transfusions to\n   maintain a plt count >50k and a hct >25. He was transferred to [**Hospital1 54**]\n   last evening at his family request for another neurosurigal opinion.\n   PMH: (in addition to the above) cad s/p cabg x4\n06; afib now off\n   coumadin; bilat dvt\ns and pe\ns s/p filter placement; prostrate ca\n   ^chol; htn; copd; gout; hyperparathyroidism; peg placement\n   Allergies: univasc-> electrolyte abnormalities; celexa->\n   lightheadedness\n   Leukocytosis\n   Assessment:\n   Repeat wbc 25 which is c/w previous data. Tmax 100.1 orally on arrival\n   to the micu.  Pt was pancultured and the foley catheter was replaced.\n   Action:\n   Received Tylenol x1 prior to a plt transfusion. Receiving abx coverage\n   for mrsa, psa, and c. diff.\n   Response:\n   Pt continues to have a low grade fever with a rising lactate level.\n   Plan:\n   Follow temperature curve; con\nt abx coverage as ordered; micu team to\n   contact osh for culture data, if cultures+, pt will likely require d/c\n   of picc line and placement of another central line.\n   Pneumonia, bacterial, ventilator acquired (VAP)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt arrived orally intubated and vented on ac. He was placed on ac\n   20x500 w/peep5 and o2 100%. A repeat abg revealed a metabolic alkalosis\n   of unknown etiology. The pt\ns pao2 was only 75 at that time. Sats >95%.\n   Lung sound rhonchorous with bibaslar rales.\n   Action:\n   Peep increased to 10cm for relative hypoxemia. A bedside us of the\n   lungs was performed by the attending w/o evidence of an empyema. A cxr\n   was also obtained.\n   Response:\n   Pt is tolerating a slow fio2 wean and is currently on o2 60%. Etiology\n   of hypoxemia in unclear.\n   [**Name2 (NI) 440**]:\n   Follow serial abg\ns with appropriate ventilatory changes; pt may need\n   an a-line placed. Per attending, pt may also have a bronchoscopy.\n   CVA (Stroke, Cerebral infarction), Hemorrhagic\n   Assessment:\n   Left sided hemiparesis. Pt is able to move his right arm up to his\n   chest, squeeze his hand, move his right leg on the bed. Perrl @3mm.\n   +corneals, gag, and cough reflexes. The pt is following simple\n   commands. He is not responding to questions re: his pain status.\n   Action:\n   Pt transfused w/1 unit plts overnoc for a goal plt count of >50. cva\n   likely hemorrhagic from the pt\ns brain tumor.\n   Response:\n   Awaiting repeat plt count results. Neuron exam unchanged.\n   Plan:\n   Follow neuron exam; transfuse as needed; neurosurgical consult in the\n   am.\n   Impaired Skin Integrity\n   Assessment:\n   +yeast perirectally. Pt has a stage II pressure sore with poorly\n   defined edges is located over his coccyx. A moderate amount of bleeding\n   from the wound is noted.\n   Action:\n   Nystatin applied to yeast. Wound was irrigated with ns and an covered\n   with allevyn dsg.\n   Response:\n   unchanged\n   Plan:\n   Please contact wound care rn for a consult in the am. Consider change\n   to a kinear bed.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 2, "start": 58, "end": 66, "concept": "Weakness", "trigger_word": "weakness", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 3, "start": 61, "end": 64, "concept": "Cerebrovascular accident", "trigger_word": "cva", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 12, "start": 4, "end": 8, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "trigger_word": "afib", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 13, "start": 19, "end": 22, "concept": "Deep Vein Thrombosis", "trigger_word": "dvt", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 16, "start": 10, "end": 13, "concept": "Hypertensive disease", "trigger_word": "htn", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 16, "start": 15, "end": 19, "concept": "Chronic Obstructive Airway Disease", "trigger_word": "copd", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 16, "start": 15, "end": 19, "concept": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of horses", "trigger_word": "copd", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 33, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Pneumonia", "trigger_word": "Pneumonia", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 35, "start": 45, "end": 47, "concept": "Actinic cheilitis", "trigger_word": "ac", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 51, "start": 3, "end": 6, "concept": "Cerebrovascular accident", "trigger_word": "CVA", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 58, "start": 68, "end": 71, "concept": "Cerebrovascular accident", "trigger_word": "cva", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 72, "start": 55, "end": 57, "concept": "Nuclear non-senile cataract", "trigger_word": "ns", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}], "row_id": 346921, "cg_id": 16273, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 102, "subject_id": 20421, "hadm_id": 168753}
