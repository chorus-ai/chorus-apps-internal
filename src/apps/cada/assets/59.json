{"text": "44 yo F with PMH of HTN, asthma and GI stromal tumor s/p multiple\n   surgeries and prolonged hospitalizations here with lactic acidosis with\n   encephalopathy and liver failure.\n   Hepatic encephalopathy\n   Assessment:\n   Patient sedated on fentanyl/versed boluses. Moves head and extr to pain\n   stimuli. Pupils at 2-3mm equal but sluggish to react. Does not follow\n   command.
