CT of abdomen done and was concerning for ischemic\n   bowel.  To OR for resection.\n   Postop:\n   Initially stable then developed rapid afib to 180 with hypotension\n   [**8-13**], failed electrical cardioversion, cardioverted with amio.\n   In and out of afib. [**Last Name (un) 3864**] placed, bedside echo done.\n   Atrial fibrillation (Afib)\n   Assessment:\n   At start of shift was in SR with HR 60\ns. SBP 110-120\ns. MAP >60 Amio\n   drip infusing @ 0.5mg/min.\n   Action:\n   Amio gtt continues. Started milrinone bolus and patient became more\n   hypotensive, so that was held. Diltiazem drip started with attempt to\n   rate control and titrated between 5-15 mg/hr. metoprolol 5 mg IV given\n   x1.\n   Response:\n   Afib with RVR best rate controlled after 5mg IV lopressor, and\n   diltiazem now titrated down to 5mg/hr. patient converted to SR\n   mid-morning and now with HR in the 60s. Levo weaned off and neo\n   titrated up to maintain MAP 60\n   Plan:\n   PTT pending for heparin titration.  continue NEO  to support BP as\n   needed and continue dilt drip at 5 mg/hr, with metoprolol PRN for\n   increased HR.\n   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)\n   Assessment:\n   Fentanyl drip titrated to maintain pain control.\n   Action:\n   Titrated down for vetn wean. Fentanyl boluses of 25mcg before turns.\n   Response:\n   Continues to grimace with turns but rests quietly when undisturbed.\n   Tolerating wean well.\n   Plan:\n   Continue fentanyl for pain with increased dose for turning and\n   procedures.\n   Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)\n   Assessment:\n   Afib as above.

Levophed changed to\n   neo to support bp with less beta agonist effect. Family updated with\n   plan and condition. TTE preformed today.  Diltiazem drip on for HR\n   control.\n   Response:\n   Continues to be pressor dependent. Continues to have activity\n   intolerance, improved since last night. Generalized edema noted and cr\n   increased indicating poor perfusion though urine output adequate.\n   Awaiting formal read of TTE\n    Plan:\n   Continue to maximize CO/CI with use of pressors/IVF boluses PRN.
