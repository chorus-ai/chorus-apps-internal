{"text": "55F PMH diabetes, colon ca s/p resection and chemotherapy, liver\n   cirrhosis (? etiology).  Initially admitted [**8-27**] to OSH for SOB, AMS,\n   confusion and lethargy x 48 hours which was thought to be\n   encephalopathy, treated with lactulose, fluids, pressors, IV ABX.\n   Intubated [**8-30**] for respiratory distress and hypoxemia, later weaned\n   from vent however mental status continued to be altered despite being\n   off sedation.  EEG showing toxic metabolis slowing, CT head negative,\n   neuro consulted and found brainstem reflexes intact but decreased\n   higher cortical function.  Although on minimal vent support no\n   improvement in mental status and therefore trached [**9-17**].  Transferred\n   to [**Hospital1 1**] for liver workup.\n   Altered mental status (not Delirium)\n   Assessment:\n   Received pt on low dose propofol, arousable to voice however not\n   tracking, withdrawing to sternal rub only, not following commands,\n   persistent non-purposeful rhythmic movements of extremities, PERRL,\n   cough/gag intact.  Afebrile and no infectious source at this time.\n   Action:\n   PO lactulose and rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy, plan for LP to\n   check for possible meningitis, liver consulted for possible SPB as\n   infectious source.  Temp curve followed.\n   Response:\n   Pt having moderate amounts of liquid brown stool from flexiseal, no\n   change in mental status, episodes of rhythmic movements continue.\n   Remains afebrile.\n   Plan:\n   Multiple cultures pending, LP results, final CT results, continue PO\n   regimen for encephalopathy, may need MRI.  Follow temp curve.\n   Impaired Skin Integrity\n   Assessment:\n   Pt with multiple skin issues\n sacral, oral, facial, gluteal.\n   Action:\n   Pt on air mattress, turned frequently, sacral/gluteal mepilex dressings\n   assessed with turns. Wound care consult ordered for sacral/gluteal\n   wounds. UBE in this AM to evaluate as well.\n   Response:\n   Plan:\n   Cirrhosis of liver, other\n   Assessment:\n   Pt with known cirrhosis from unknown etiology.  Pt has percutaneous\n   gall bladder drain in place draining large amounts of serous colored\n   fluid.  Pt slightly coagulopathic with elevated INR and decreased\n   platelets.\n   Action:\n   Hepatology consulted, CBC/coags to be checked [**Hospital1 **], MICU team\n   questioning DIC, FDP pending, safe environment maintained, blood draws\n   minimized.\n   Response:\n   1500 labs show\n   Plan:\n   Hepatology following, continue to monitor CBC/coags, FFP if needed.\n   Alteration in Nutrition\n   Assessment:\n   Received pt NPO, OGT clamped, placement checked by instilling air,\n   minimal residuals, abdomen soft, non-tender.  Pt with lap band in\n   place, meds given in minimal doses as tolerated.\n   Action:\n   Nutrition consult placed for tube feed recommendations. Surgery\n   consulted for PEG placement give lap band in place.\n   Response:\n   Plan:\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 1, "start": 8, "end": 16, "concept": "Diabetes Mellitus", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0011849", "trigger_word": "diabetes", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1623038", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Liver Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0023890", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 69, "end": 72, "concept": "Dyspnea", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0013404", "trigger_word": "SOB", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 3, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Confusion", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0009676", "trigger_word": "confusion", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 3, "start": 17, "end": 25, "concept": "Lethargy", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0023380", "trigger_word": "lethargy", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 28, "end": 48, "concept": "Respiratory distress", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0476273", "trigger_word": "respiratory distress", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 12, "start": 3, "end": 24, "concept": "Abnormal mental state", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0278061", "trigger_word": "Altered mental status", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 12, "start": 30, "end": 38, "concept": "Delirium", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0011206", "trigger_word": "Delirium", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 17, "start": 3, "end": 8, "concept": "Coughing", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0010200", "trigger_word": "cough", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 20, "start": 22, "end": 32, "concept": "Meningitis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0025289", "trigger_word": "meningitis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 24, "start": 3, "end": 26, "concept": "Mental Status Change", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0856054", "trigger_word": "change in mental status", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 39, "start": 3, "end": 21, "concept": "Liver Cirrhosis", "trigger_word": "Cirrhosis of liver", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 41, "start": 17, "end": 26, "concept": "Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1623038", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 13}, {"num_sents": 41, "start": 17, "end": 26, "concept": "Liver Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0023890", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 14}], "row_id": 600520, "cg_id": 20871, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 37, "subject_id": 70206, "hadm_id": 162850}
