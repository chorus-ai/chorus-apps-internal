{"text": "Mr. [**Known lastname 6130**] is a 68 yo with met renal cell CA (to lung and brain)\n   admitted on [**2124-2-29**] for week 2 of high dose IL-2 therapy.  His last\n   dose was complicated by shock requiring dopamine and brief atrial\n   fibrillation, spontaneously reverting back when dopamine was changed to\n   neo.  His current course was given from [**2-29**] to [**3-4**] and has been\n   complicated by nausea/vomiting, encephalopathy, diarrhea, rigors,\n   hypotension in the 70s systolic requiring neo ARF with decreasing UOP\n   (355 total cc's on [**3-5**], none on [**3-4**], + ~ 14L LOC but without detailed\n   recording of his UOP), and progressive metabolic acidosis despite\n   bicarb infusion. His Cr has risen progressively from 1.9 on admission\n   to 6.6 on the evening of transfer.  Because of his progressive renal\n   failure, dopamine was added to improve renal perfusion. Pt. transferred\n   here to ICU early morning [**3-6**] for further management of hypotension\n   and renal failure.\n   Events;Pt went into rapid Afib with HR 130-150,NBP systolic dropped to\n   65 ,MD [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1523**],NS 1L bolused,pt already on lovo,added neo and\n   titrated,HR continued to be as high as 150,cardiverted with 100J,150 J\n   respectively,ABG done,NBp improved Amiodarone gtt started and team at\n   [**Last Name (Titles) 1523**],will call wife and update.\n   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt. continues in renal failure Foley in place draining scant amounts of\n   dark amber urine.\n   Action:\n   UO monitored closely. BUN/Cr monitored as well.\n   Response:\n   UO remains scant. BUN/Cr as noted above. Pt. with total body anasarca\n   and weeping edema.\n   Plan:\n   Monitor UO and BUN/Cr. Renal following pt. closely. CRRT may be\n   possibility if renal function does not improve.\n   Altered mental status (not Delirium)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt. extremely confused  and agitated  while waking him up for\n   assessments and care,Pulling at tubes, taking off clothing.\n   Action:\n    MD informed.Bed in lowest position and locked. Side rails up. All\n   tubes concealed.upper extrimities are restrained for safety.\n   Did not require  any meds  at the beginning,then continued to be\n   agitated,medicated with Ativan 1Mg with effect.\n   Response:\n   Pt. continues to be agitated and confused mostly with stimulation\n   Plan:\n   Maintain pt. safety. [**Name (NI) **] pt. as often as needed. Continue with IV\n   ativan PRN.\n   Impaired Skin Integrity\n   Assessment:\n   Pt. with sloughing skin from IL 2 therapy. Pt. also with multiple\n   excoriated areas on coccyx and scrotum.\n   Action:\n   PRN lotions applied to dry skin as needed.\n   Pt. turned from side to side to keep off coccyx.\n   Response:\n   Ongoing assessment. Pt. continues with multiple skin issues.\n   Plan:\n   PRN lotions as ordered. Keep pt. off coccyx as often as possible.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 6, "start": 51, "end": 59, "concept": "Diarrhea", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0011991", "trigger_word": "diarrhea", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 7, "start": 49, "end": 52, "concept": "Rheumatic Fever", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035436", "trigger_word": "ARF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 8, "start": 64, "end": 67, "concept": "Butting", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0233535", "trigger_word": "but", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 14, "start": 7, "end": 20, "concept": "Kidney Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035078", "trigger_word": "renal failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 15, "start": 29, "end": 33, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "trigger_word": "Afib", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 16, "start": 67, "end": 69, "concept": "Nuclear non-senile cataract", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1112705", "trigger_word": "NS", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 20, "start": 3, "end": 16, "concept": "Kidney Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035078", "trigger_word": "Renal failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 20, "start": 25, "end": 44, "concept": "Pre-renal acute kidney injury", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C3854173", "trigger_word": "Acute renal failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 20, "start": 46, "end": 49, "concept": "Rheumatic Fever", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035436", "trigger_word": "ARF", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 22, "start": 20, "end": 33, "concept": "Kidney Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035078", "trigger_word": "renal failure", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 32, "start": 3, "end": 24, "concept": "Abnormal mental state", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0278061", "trigger_word": "Altered mental status", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 32, "start": 30, "end": 38, "concept": "Delirium", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0011206", "trigger_word": "Delirium", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 34, "start": 17, "end": 25, "concept": "Confusion", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0009676", "trigger_word": "confused", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 34, "start": 31, "end": 39, "concept": "Agitation", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0085631", "trigger_word": "agitated", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 13}, {"num_sents": 40, "start": 3, "end": 11, "concept": "Agitation", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0085631", "trigger_word": "agitated", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 14}, {"num_sents": 42, "start": 23, "end": 31, "concept": "Agitation", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0085631", "trigger_word": "agitated", "occ": 3, "concept_id": 15}, {"num_sents": 42, "start": 36, "end": 44, "concept": "Confusion", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0009676", "trigger_word": "confused", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 16}], "row_id": 514701, "cg_id": 16037, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 14, "subject_id": 49496, "hadm_id": 112342}
