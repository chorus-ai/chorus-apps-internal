{"text": "Ms. [**Known lastname 5387**] is a 62 year-old woman with a history of hypertension and\n   hyperlipidemia who initially presented to an OSH on [**3-18**] with\n   pneumonia, now being transferred to [**Hospital1 5**] for further evaluation of\n   hypoxia.\n   Patient initially presented to her PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**3-16**] with cough and SOB; CXR\n   at that time reportedly showed no infiltrate; antibiotics were started\n   as an outpatient.  Then admitted to the OSH on [**3-18**] with cough and\n   diarrhea and was found to have a LLL PNA.  Started on Levaquin IV.\n   Blood cultures and legionella antigen were negative.  A few days into\n   the hospitalization, IV steroids were started.  On [**3-24**] an ABG was\n   obtained and showed 7.48/38/57.  A CT was done and showed bilateral\n   infiltrates and no PE; zosyn was started.  An echo was also done and\n   showed normal EF and mild pulmonary hypertension.  On [**3-30**], IV\n   vancomycin was started.  Given concern for PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 5388**] was started\n   on day of transfer.  Given persistent hypoxia, transfer to BIMDC was\n   arranged.\n          Cxr w/ bilat. Ground glass opacity.\n          EKG done, non specific changes\n          Abg 7.37/41/56 on non-invasive mask ventilation 100% Fio2,\n   and PS 10. Plan for intubation for CT as Pt. w/ significant desats.\n   With out O2, and does not tolerate laying flat.\n          Lab:  wbc 17.1 today, up from 16.6, pending HIV test at\n   transferring facility done 3.27\n   Anxiety\n   Assessment:\n   Pt. with known hx of acute anxiety, clonipin and imiprimine for home\n   regimen..

RR in 30-45\ns awakes easily to noise or voice.  17.1.\n   afebrile.\n   Action:\n   Non-invasive mask ventilation, following abg\ns, likely plan for\n   intubation.  Once resp. status stable plan for CT, and ? bronch. Nebs\n   when appropriate.  Judicious use of IVF for hydration EF wnl.\n   Response:\n   Little response noted to wob.  Some improvement in abg\n   Plan:\n   Prob. Intubation at some point today. Further studies to fully\n   understand causative [**Doctor Last Name **].
