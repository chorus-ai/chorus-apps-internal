{"text": "Pt 80yo female S/P recent hospitalization at [**Hospital1 3633**] with CP, she was\n   cathed and found to have 3VD, 95% LM not intervened on in cath lab and\n   surgery felt she was too high risk for surgery. She was DC\nd home and\n   then had reoccurrence of chest pain 2 days later, ruled in at [**Hospital1 4328**] for STEMI ( Inferior MI). Peak cpk 1350. Sent here for\n   re-evalulation CABG.  Pt admitted on heparin and ntg, NTG weaned off\n   [**7-29**], remains on heparin. Surgery came by to see pt and now have\n   cardiac cath films from [**Hospital1 3633**] as of [**7-30**].\n   *Temp pacing wire inserted [**7-30**] for bradycardia 28-30 Afib s/p inferior\n   MI.  Has experienced some confusion over past few days but cooperative\n   w/ care. Alert and oriented x [**2-16**].  Supportive dtrs have been staying\n   with pt, [**Name (NI) **] at bedside overnight to translate. Renal consulted [**7-31**]\n   for poor urine output and rising creat. Liver also following.\n   Lisinopril and Cardiac meds currently on hold.\n   .\n   Coronary artery disease (CAD, ischemic heart disease)\n   Assessment:\n   Temp pacing wire placed [**7-30**] for bradycardic Afib 20s-30s in setting of\n   new inferior STEMI.  VVI @ 70 BPM. Appropriate sensing and capture.\n   RIJ site CDI. BP 90s/40s-50s w/ MAPs>60. Denied CP/SOB.  IV heparin gtt\n   therapeutic @ 400 units/hr.\n   Action:\n   Temp wire tested per protocol, mA captures at 2.5  (set MA to 7) and\n   sensitivity threshold 2.0\n   Sensitivity set to 1.  Pt\ns intrinsic rhythm apparent during testing\n   and throughout shift: atrial fibrillation@ 50-60sBPM.  Cont\nd IV\n   heparin gtt. Continue to hold cardiac meds.\n   Response:\n   *HR 70s V-paced w/ appropriate sensing. Occasional failure to capture\n   beat. Intrinsic rhythm now improved to 50s-60s AF. BP w/ maps in 60s.\n   Plan:\n   *Continue to monitor hemodynamics. Cont temp transvenous pacing.\n   *Continue IV heparin. Holding BP/HR meds.\n   * Cardiac surgery evaluating pt for potential CABG- awaiting their\n   review of cath lab films from OSH and input from other consulted teams.\n   *Renal following for ARF\n   *Hepatology following given pt\ns hx of HCV cirrhosis which puts her at\n   a higher surgical risk. Awaiting liver MRI report for OSH which\n   daughter will pick up today.\n   * Plan today [**8-1**] for meeting w/ pt\ns family/ CCU team/ ?CSURG team to\n   discuss goals of care and plans for possible surgery.\n   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)\n   Assessment:\n   Low urine output, though improved from last night @  mainly 20 ml per\n   hour average. RIJ cordis transduced for CVP [**Location (un) **]: [**11-27**]. Pt with new\n   UTI per UA, intermittent c/o suprapubic discomfort.\n   Action:\n   Started on PO cipro for UTI. Foley cath changed. Renal following pt.\n   Monitored UOP/ BUN/Creat. FENA<1%. No IVF ordered over night.\n   Response:\n   Pt continues to have low urine output. Creat stable. Prerenal vs ATN.\n   Plan:\n   Continue to monitor UOP, BUN/Creat.  Monitor closely for hypotension.\n   Avoid nephrotoxins.\n   Goal CVP is 15.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 9, "start": 63, "end": 67, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0004238", "trigger_word": "Afib", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 10, "start": 29, "end": 38, "concept": "Confusion", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0009676", "trigger_word": "confusion", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 18, "start": 54, "end": 58, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0004238", "trigger_word": "Afib", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 20, "start": 54, "end": 57, "concept": "Dyspnea", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0013404", "trigger_word": "SOB", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 27, "start": 25, "end": 44, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "trigger_word": "atrial fibrillation", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 38, "start": 24, "end": 27, "concept": "Rheumatic Fever", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035436", "trigger_word": "ARF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 40, "start": 12, "end": 21, "concept": "Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1623038", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 40, "start": 12, "end": 21, "concept": "Liver Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0023890", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 46, "start": 3, "end": 16, "concept": "Kidney Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035078", "trigger_word": "Renal failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 46, "start": 25, "end": 44, "concept": "Pre-renal acute kidney injury", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C3854173", "trigger_word": "Acute renal failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 46, "start": 46, "end": 49, "concept": "Rheumatic Fever", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035436", "trigger_word": "ARF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 50, "start": 3, "end": 6, "concept": "Urinary tract infection", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0042029", "trigger_word": "UTI", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 50, "start": 43, "end": 53, "concept": "Discomfort", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C2364135", "trigger_word": "discomfort", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 52, "start": 27, "end": 30, "concept": "Urinary tract infection", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0042029", "trigger_word": "UTI", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 13}, {"num_sents": 55, "start": 68, "end": 71, "concept": "Oculocutaneous albinism type 1A", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C4551504", "trigger_word": "ATN", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 14}], "row_id": 465683, "cg_id": 19062, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 136, "subject_id": 85464, "hadm_id": 164726}
