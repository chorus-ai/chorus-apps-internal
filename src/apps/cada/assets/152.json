Finger stick was 96. She had just been\nadministered SC heparin for DVT prophylaxis.  Given concern for\na stroke, paramedics were called.  When they arrived, her\nglucose was apparently low and glucagon was administered.  An IO\nwas placed in the left leg and an amp of D50 was administered.\nShe was brought to the ED, where blood sugar was noted to be 16.\n She received another amp of D50.  Glucose improved transiently\nbut again came down to 40.  Intravenous dextrose (D10W) was\nstarted.  She had improvement, but several additional\nhypoglycemic episodes.\n\nHer white count was noted to be 15,000, and a lactate was 4.0.\nHer blood pressure remained normotensive.  Her temperature was\n99.6.  She had a CT head and abdomen/pelvis which revealed no\ninfectious focus.  She does have ulcers of dorsum of both lower\nextremities which were treated with keflex 2 weeks prior; these\nare dry and non-seeping.  Recently she also had a diagnosis of\nDVT after a hospitalization in [**Month (only) 956**] for left hip fracture,\nfor which an ORIF was performed.  She was started on coumadin\nand completed a course of coumadin on [**3-27**].  Since then, she\nhas been transitioned to SC heparin for prophylaxis.  There is\nno history of hypoglycemia prior to this episode; she has no\nknown history of diabetes; there is no reason to suspect\nsurreptious insulin use.  She does not use Chinese herbal\nmedications.  She denies dry skin, fevers, changes in bowel\nmovements.  She has lost 10 lbs of weight while at the nursing\nhome following the hip fracture and surgery.  Review of systems\notherwise negative.\n\nEndocrine was consulted who recommended several lab tests,\ninclude C-peptide, sulfonylurea level, beta-hydroxybutyrate.\n\nShe was admitted to the MICU given her recurrent hypoglycemia\nfor management and further workup.  At time of transfer, her\nvitals revealed a HR of 88, a temp of 99.6, SaO2 of 98% on RA.\n\n\nPast Medical History:\nDementia\nHypertension\nGERD\nOsteoporosis\nUlcers on Dorsi of feet\nleft hip ORIF [**2158-12-27**] c/b DVT\n\n\nSocial History:\nUp until [**Month (only) 956**], lived independantly in [**Hospital3 4634**] near\n[**Location (un) 86**] Common where she managed her own affairs - there was an\naide that visited her 1 hour / day.  She fractured her hip in\n[**Month (only) **] of this year requiring hospital admission; following ORIF\nshe developed a DVT for which she required anticoagulation.  She\nwas transitioned to [**Hospital6 1643**] (nursing home) for the\nlast two months given her fracture.  She has a grand-daughter\n([**Name (NI) **]) who accompanies her today.  Her daughter is the\nhealth-care proxy who lives in the area.  She is Cantonese and\nspeaks a Cantonese dialect.

Despite several doses of D50 blood sugars\nremained 40s-90s at ED.  She does not have history of DM, does\nnot take insulin or hypoglycemic agents, and does not have\nhistory of hypoglycemia.  She was started on D10 drip which was\ncontinued in ICU untiil sugars were consistently in 100s.  Drip\nwas stopped and sugars remained in normal range.  She was\ntolerating po without difficulty.  Endocrine was curbsided in ED\nwho recommended sending pro-insulin, sulfonylurea, C-peptide,\nbeta-hydroxybutyrate levels.  TSH and cortisol were checked\ngiven concern for panhypopituitarism.  AM cortisol was wnl; TSH\nwas low but free T4 within normal range.  There was some\nsuspicion that she may have accidentally been administered\ninsulin at rehab, which the rehab denied. Possible infectious\ncauses were investigated but CXR and U/A were unremarkable.\nBlood cultures were sent, which are both no growth to date.  EKG\nwas unremarkable.  Only possible source of infection were ulcers\non dorsum of both feet which were treated per below.\n\nWhile on the floor, the patient's blood sugars were checked\nevery four hours initially, then spaced out to q8h.  The patient\nmaintained her sugars between 85-200.  After discharge, it was\nfound that the patient's c-peptide levels were elevated.  The\npatient's grand daughter and the patient's PCP were both\n[**Name (NI) 653**], as there is concern that the patient may have an\ninsulinoma.  The patient was scheduled for an appt to see an\nendocrinologist at [**Last Name (un) **] on [**4-5**].  The patient's grand\ndaughter was cautioned re: the signs and symptoms of\nhypogylcemia and instructed to give the patient juice and\nimmediately bring her to the ED for evaluation.\n\n# leukocytosis:  The patient presented with an elevated white\ncount and lactate; an ifectious work-up was negative, except for\nthe ulcers on her feet b/l (see below).  It was thought that her\nwhite count could have been due to hypoglycemic state.  She was\nultimately started on bactrim/keflex for presumed cellulitis.\nHowever, on transfer to the floor, the decision was made to d/c\nantibiotics, as the patient remained afebrile.  The patient is\nalso s/p ORIF--> there was a thought of posisbly having infected\nhardware in the setting of elevated CRP/ES; however, plain film\nof the hip was negative for any acute hardware complications.\nHer CRP and ESR should be repeated as an outpatient.\n\n# Cellulitis: Pt had an ulcer on dorsum of each feet with dried\nblood; no active purulent draiange.  While in the MICU, it was\nnoted that the surrounding skin was erythematous and warm to\ntouch.  After lactate had normalized, she was started on bactrim\nand keflex for cellulitis.  Inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) were\nchecked which were elevated.\n\nWhile on the floor, the patient was seen by podiatry who\nrecommended wet to dry dressing for the R ulcer, and collagenase\nfor  ulcer.  A plain film of her feet were both negative for\nosteomyelitis or any fractures.  Because the patient was\nafebrile with white count normalizing, the patient's antibiotics\nwere discontinued.  It was thought that her initial elevated\nwhite count could be a stress response to the state of\nhypoglycemia.\n.\n# foot ulcers: While in the MICU, it was initially thought there\nwas some surrounding erythema that could be consistent with\ncellulitis around each foot ulcer, and the patient was started\non Bactrim/Keflex.   On the floor, the patent had plain films of\nher feet which were normal.  Podiatry was consulted and\nrecommended collagenase to the L ulcer and wet to dry dressings\nto the R foot ulcer.  Ultimately, the patient's Bactrim/Keflex\nwere both stopped.\n.\n# Dementia:  The patient was continued on her home exelon.\n.\n# Osteoporosis:  The patient is s/p hip fracture complicated by\nDVT s/p 3 months of coumadin.  The patient was continued on\nheparin SC while in patient, as well as calcium and Vitamin D.\n\n# HTN:  The patient is on lasix at home.  While in house the\npatient's Lasix was held.  She was instructed to restart her\nLasix as an outpatient.  This should also be followed up as an\noutpatient.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n- The patient was found to have an elevated C-peptide, which\nsuggests that there was endogenous insulin secretion; she will\nhave to have an endocrine evaluation, including imaging, to\nassess for an insulinoma. The patient's PCP was [**Name (NI) 653**] with\nthis information, as was the patient's grand daughter [**Name (NI) **].\nThe patient was made a follow-up appt with [**Last Name (un) **] for further\nwork up of this insulinoma on Thursday, [**4-5**].  The patient's\ngranddaughter was also cautioned about the signs/symptoms of\nhypoglycemic events and that fast administration of sugar is\nnecessary, as well as immediately calling an ambulance and\nbringing the patient to the emergency room for evaluation.\n\n- The patient will need to have a CRP/ESR repeated as an\noutpatient.\n\n- The patient is not currently on a bisphosphonate in the\nsetting of her recent hip fracture.  This is something that\nshould be followed up as an outpatient.\n\nMedications on Admission:\nEnlive 198 ml [**Hospital1 **]\nheparin SC TID\ncalcium with Vit D 600mg/200IU\ndocusate 100 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nrivastigmine 3 mg [**Hospital1 **]\nsenna 2 tabs [**Hospital1 **]\noxycodone 10 mg TID\nlasix 20 mg daily\n\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1.
