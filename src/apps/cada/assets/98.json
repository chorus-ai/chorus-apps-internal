{"text": "60 year old male with a history of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of\n   the oropharynx and tongue who intitially presented on [**2128-8-6**] after a\n   syncopal episode at home when standing from sitting position.  He fell\n   to the ground hitting his hands and knees.  There was no head trauma or\n   loss of consciousness.   There was no witnessed seizure like activity.\n   There was no confusion or disorientation.  He felt weak and shakey\n   after he stood back up. Further history revealed poor PO intake over\n   the preceding few weeks since prior discharge from the hospital on\n   [**2128-7-28**].  It was during that hospitalization that his cancer was\n   diagnosed.\n   In the ED his initial vitals were T: 98.4, HR: 100, BP: 92/64, RR: 17,\n   O2: 96% room air. Orthostatics were not checked. He had a CXR which\n   showed hyperinflation but no acute cardiopulmonary abnormalities and\n   multiple compression fractures of vertebrae.  He had a CT of the head\n   which was negative for acute process.  Knee films were negative for\n   fracture or dislocation.  He received aspirin 325 mg x1 and morphine 4\n   mg IV.  He was admitted to the cardiology service given syncope and\n   borderline elevated troponins (0.5).\n   While on the cardiology service he was initially started on IVF for\n   hydration out of concern that his syncopal episode was related to his\n   poor PO intake and dehydration.  He was ruled out for myocardial\n   infarction and transferred to the oncology service.  Given his poor\n   oral intake he underwent PEG placement on [**2128-8-12**].  He was started on\n   dexamethasone in preparation for starting chemotherapy on [**2128-8-12**].\n   Also on [**2128-8-12**] the patient was noted to complain of left lower\n   quadrant abdominal pain with hematuria.  He underwent CT of the abdomen\n   and pelvis which did not reveal etiology of his abdominal pain but did\n   show debris in the right lower lobe bronchus and right lower lobe air\n   space disease most likely atelectasis with small bilateral pleural\n   effusions. On [**2128-8-13**] he was started on a morphine PCA for pain control\n   secondary to jaw and back pain.  Per his wife in this setting he became\n   more somnolent.  Overnight on [**2128-8-14**] he was noted to develop a new 2L\n   oxygen requirement.  He desaturated to 83-84% off oxygen.  CXR\n   performed in this setting was concerning for bilateral pleural\n   effusions and atelectasis.  He was treated with IV lasix with good\n   urine output but no improvement in his oxygenation status.  On the\n   morning of [**2128-8-15**] he was noted to be requiring higher levels of\n   facemask oxygen up to 10L.  He was also noted to be hypotensive in the\n   high 80s systolic.  He underwent emergent CTA which was negative for\n   pulmonary embolism but showed right lower lobe partial collapse, debris\n   in the right lobe bronchus and bilateral pleural effusions.\n   On arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] he continued to have significant oxygen\n   requirement and complained of being short of breath.  Per oncology\n   notes he was also complaining of left sided chest pain but he did not\n   note this to ICU team.  Anesthesia and ENT were emergently consulted\n   given rapidly rising oxygen requirement and lack of ability to orally\n   intubate.  Decision was made to proceed with nasotracheal intubation\n   which proceded without complication.  Periprocedure he was been on\n   propofol with decrease in his blood pressures to the 70s systolic\n   requiring levophed.\n   Shock, septic\n   Assessment:\n   Action:\n   Response:\n   Plan:\n   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 11**])\n   Assessment:\n   Action:\n   Response:\n   Plan:\n   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)\n   Assessment:\n   Action:\n   Response:\n   Plan:\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 3, "start": 3, "end": 19, "concept": "Syncopal Episode", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0751534", "trigger_word": "syncopal episode", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 6, "start": 16, "end": 25, "concept": "Confusion", "trigger_word": "confusion", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 6, "start": 29, "end": 43, "concept": "Disorientation", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0233407", "trigger_word": "disorientation", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 6, "start": 54, "end": 58, "concept": "Weakness", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C3714552", "trigger_word": "weak", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 9, "start": 24, "end": 27, "concept": "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0043194", "trigger_word": "was", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 20, "start": 37, "end": 53, "concept": "Syncopal Episode", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0751534", "trigger_word": "syncopal episode", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 27, "start": 51, "end": 65, "concept": "Abdominal Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0000737", "trigger_word": "abdominal pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 29, "start": 9, "end": 16, "concept": "Disease", "trigger_word": "disease", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 31, "start": 24, "end": 33, "concept": "Back Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0004604", "trigger_word": "back pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 32, "start": 8, "end": 17, "concept": "Somnolence", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C2830004", "trigger_word": "somnolent", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 43, "start": 39, "end": 54, "concept": "Dyspnea", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0013404", "trigger_word": "short of breath", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 56, "start": 3, "end": 22, "concept": "Respiratory Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1145670", "trigger_word": "Respiratory failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 61, "start": 17, "end": 27, "concept": "Acute onset pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0184567", "trigger_word": "acute pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 61, "start": 29, "end": 41, "concept": "Chronic pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0150055", "trigger_word": "chronic pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 13}], "row_id": 480829, "cg_id": 16302, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 98, "subject_id": 61068, "hadm_id": 118597}
