{"text": "83 yo M with a PMH of HTN and HLD who developed abrupt onset L sided\n   weakness, was taken to an OSH and given TPA, and then transferred to\n   [**Hospital1 1**] for further management. Upon arrival to the [**Hospital1 1**] ED, he had a\n   persistent dense L hemiplegia as well as significant dysarthria. Repeat\n   imaging of his head showed no bleeding or vessel obstruction, therefore\n   no arterial interventions could be performed.  The patient continued to\n   have L hemiplegia, slurred speech, and then failed a speech and swallow\n   evaluation so he was started on tube feeds via NGT.  Per his family,\n   the pt was unable to speak, but was communicating with them up to 1 day\n   prior to his ICU transfer, at which time he became less communicative.\n   On the morning of [**1-15**], the patient developed hypoxia with saturation\n   of 79% on RA. He was suctioned with return of tube feedings. He was\n   placed on NRB with oxygen saturation of 90-95%. An ABG revealed PaO2 of\n   67, at which point the patient was transferred to the MICU and\n   intubated.  Pt now thought to have aspiration PNA r/t stroke and\n   aspiration of TF.\n   EVENTS:  PEG placed at bedside this AM. Pt received 10mg vecuronium and\n   lg amts sedation. PEG ok to use for meds, but otherwise should be to\n   gravity for 24 hrs post placement (until 10am [**1-18**]).\n   Pneumonia, aspiration\n   Assessment:\n   Pt requiring sxning q2hrs for moderate amts thick yellow/tan, blood\n   tinged sputum. Gag remains very weak but pt has strong cough while\n   being suctioned. Febrile to 101.8 today. Chest xray this AM showing\n   worsening PNA.\n   Action:\n   Aggressive pulm toilet/ frequent suctioning. Pt on vanc/ceftaz for\n   coverage of MRSA. Repeat sputem sample sent. Per team, pt to have\n   bronchoscopy tomorrow.\n   Response:\n   Sats 92-97%. Pt intermittently put on CMV for PEG placement, but weaned\n   back to PSV 40%/[**4-25**] and tolerating well.\n   Plan:\n   Plan for RSBI overnoc and SBT. Extubation temporarily planned for\n   tomorrow pending pt\ns MS and ability to gag/cough.\n   Fever (Hyperthermia, Pyrexia, not Fever of Unknown Origin)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt with temp 101.1 @ 08, 101.5 @ 12, 101.8 @ 1400.\n   Action:\n   Blood cultures x2 (peripheral and arterial), urine, and sputem cultures\n   all resent. 650mg Tylenol given via PEG. Pt cont on Vanco and ceftaz\n   for coverage of MRSA. Ice packs applied to groin/armpits in attempt to\n   reduce fever.\n   Response:\n   Cultures with no growth to date. Cont with IV abx. Temp down to 99.8 @\n   1730.\n   Plan:\n   Cont to monitor temps. Cont with IV abx.
