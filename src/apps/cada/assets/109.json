{"text": "Ms. [**Known lastname 7451**] is a 79F with h/o DM, MGUS, and pulmonary fibrosis not on\n   O2 at home who was admitted [**5-20**] with progressive fatigue and malaise\n   progressive over several months' time.\n   .\n   Vitals on presentation to the ED were 98.4 P 76 BP 176/80 RR 18 and O2\n   sat 86% on room air. CBC was notable for WBC of 15, and she had a large\n   R sided infiltrate. She was started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin for\n   presumed community-acquired pneumonia and admitted to the medical floor\n   for further management. Her course on the floor was notable for O2\n   requirement of 5-6L via nasal canula, but she was otherwise clinically\n   stable. The morning of transfer, she experienced an increased O2\n   requirement, dropping to 84% on 6L NC with improvement to the low 90's\n   on a non-rebreather. Given her worsened hypoxemia, she was transferred\n   to the ICU for closer monitoring. Labs the day of transfer notable for\n   Hct drop 23->19 for which she was transfused with 1 U PRBC and almost\n   all of an additional unit until she showed s/s of ? reaction.\n   Pneumonia, bacterial, community acquired (CAP)\n   Assessment:\n   Received pt on NRB 100% with Sp02 96%, intermittent exp wheezes in\n   upper fields with fine crackles at bases. RR 20\ns with increases to\n   30\ns after turning. Dry cough. Tmax 100.1 orally; WBC increased to 16.6\n   Action:\n   Out of bed to chair with nurse assist- tolerated transfer well but c/o\n   fatigue after an hour. Switched 02 to High flow neb at 100%. CT of\n   chest w/o contrast. Frequent turns. Encouraged CDB and IS. Abx. BC x1,\n   Tylenol given for temp\n   Response:\n   Pt remained on 100% high flow neb with Sp02 94% but began to drop to\n   88-90%, placed back on NRB. [**Name (NI) **] pt needs frequent reminders to focus on\n   deep breathing and little talking. Fine crackles remain at bases. Dry\n   cough persists, tiny amount of sputum with blood coughed up early but\n   it was after blood from nose from 02- no sputum produced since\n   Plan:\n   Continue with broad coverage Abx as ? source of PNA continues. Unclear\n   of etiology behind hypoxemia, possibly could be viral or bacteria PNA,\n   advanced ILD. Follow temp curve. Follow CT results. Encouraged OOB, IS,\n   CDB. Wean supplemental 02 as tolerated. Question of bronch\n   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)\n   Assessment:\n   Bun 38, Cr 2.2. UO 50 cc/hr, urine yellow and clear. UA (+) WBC, RBC\n   with casts, and protein.\n   Action:\n   Renal ultrasound. D/C ASA as renal wants to do a biopsy\n   Response:\n   UO remains marginal 30-50 cc/hr.\n   Plan:\n   Renal biopsy later this week. Monitor UO and lytes. ? due to myeloma\n   work up needed\n   Hematology consulted today to regarding ? multiple myeloma diagnosis-\n   s/s suggestive of at this time chronic fatigue past few months, ARF,\n   hypoxemia. Apparently pts PCP had been concerned about this prior to\n   admission and was trying to coordinate a hematology consult. Skeletal\n   survey done. BM biopsy  needed once resp status improves\n   ON: pt has very poor access, currently 2 peripheral but hard to even\n   stick for labs, PICC order in but team was told it could no be placed\n   until Tuesday. ? A-line placement for lab draws and ABGs\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 1, "start": 48, "end": 50, "concept": "MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY 1", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C3250443", "trigger_word": "DM", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 59, "end": 66, "concept": "Fatigue", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0015672", "trigger_word": "fatigue", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 71, "end": 78, "concept": "Malaise", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0231218", "trigger_word": "malaise", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 17, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Pneumonia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0032285", "trigger_word": "Pneumonia", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 19, "start": 59, "end": 66, "concept": "Wheezing", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0043144", "trigger_word": "wheezes", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 23, "start": 17, "end": 26, "concept": "Dry cough", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0850149", "trigger_word": "Dry cough", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 26, "start": 3, "end": 10, "concept": "Fatigue", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0015672", "trigger_word": "fatigue", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 32, "start": 3, "end": 17, "concept": "Breathing abnormally deep", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C1321587", "trigger_word": "deep breathing", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 33, "start": 3, "end": 8, "concept": "Coughing", "trigger_word": "cough", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 40, "start": 3, "end": 16, "concept": "Kidney Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035078", "trigger_word": "Renal failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 40, "start": 25, "end": 44, "concept": "Pre-renal acute kidney injury", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C3854173", "trigger_word": "Acute renal failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 40, "start": 46, "end": 49, "concept": "Rheumatic Fever", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035436", "trigger_word": "ARF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 52, "start": 67, "end": 70, "concept": "Rheumatic Fever", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035436", "trigger_word": "ARF", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 12}], "row_id": 458348, "cg_id": 19681, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 109, "subject_id": 77195, "hadm_id": 132029}
