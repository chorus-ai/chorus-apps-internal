{"text": "This is an 80 yo female w/PMed Hx of CAD, CABG, DMwho came from the heb\n   Reb with SOB.  At Heb Reb she had 1 week of fevers and altered mental\n   status, her alter MS coincided with the administration of baclofen and\n   dilaudid\n these were D/Ced.  On [**3-8**] her 02 SAT was 80% on RA and 90%\n   on 3 liters; this initiated her transfer to [**Hospital1 54**].  In the EW her temp\n   was 100.8, 163/73,101, 18 99% on 3 liters.  An EKG showed 1mm ST\n   depressions in V4-5, BNP was 4005 and her CXR showed multifocal\n   pneumonia.\n    Pt ruled out for MI this admission. TTE showed diastolic dysfunction.\n   Continues to struggle with hypoxia/resp distress with absolutely no\n   reserve..  Supplemental O2 is maxed out at 95% high flow neb with\n   frequent episodes tachypnea to 40\ns. Pt restless at times. Team would\n   like to get chest CT and bronchial lavage but feel she would need to be\n   intubated for either of these procedures. They plan to insert A-line\n   today.\n   Pt Complains of chronic back and neck pain. Receives PRN Percocet and\n   TID neurontin 300mg for the complaints of pain.\n   Access has been an issue today. Her midline was phlebitic and needed to\n   be d/c\nd. Warm compresses applied Q4hr. I was not able to insert new\n   PIV> IVT came and got second PIV placed and later came to insert PICC\n   in left AC.\n   Pneumonia, bacterial, hospital acquired (non-VAP)\n   Assessment:\n   Action:\n   Response:\n   Plan:\n   Heart failure (CHF), Diastolic, Acute\n   Assessment:\n   Pt\ns vital signs stable on lisinopril 40mg PO QD as well as lopressor\n   25mg PO BID for rate/BP control\n   Action:\n   Checking BP on lower right arm due to phlebitis on upper right and new\n   PICC in left AC\n   Response:\n   BP is stable. Will hold off on diuresis for now because pt is\n   co,mplaining of thirst and creatinine is slightly higher today.\n   Plan:\n   Consider diuresis later if needed. Continue to follow labs/vital signs\n   closely.\n   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)\n   Assessment:\n   Pt complains of left neck, shoulder, back pain constantly.\n   Action:\n   Gets slight relief from one percocet and one Tylenol given twice this\n   shift. Also pt repositioned and given back rub with increased comfort.\n   Response:\n   Slight improvement in comfort from percocet, Tylenol and position\n   change with back rub.\n   Plan:\n   Continue pain relief measures as tolerated.\n   Numerous family members in to see pt today (she has six children) I\n   have asked them to  limit visit time and numbers because pt will not\n   stop wanting to interact with them and becomes hypoxic easily while\n   they visit. She also has coughing jags while she tries to talk and\n   desaturates easily. Family seems to understand and comply with my\n   wishes but with so many here it is difficult for her to rest. We will\n   need to continue to request that they limit pt stimulation.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 2, "start": 12, "end": 15, "concept": "Dyspnea", "trigger_word": "SOB", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 47, "end": 53, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "fevers", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 8, "start": 3, "end": 14, "concept": "Mental Depression", "trigger_word": "depressions", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 9, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Pneumonia", "trigger_word": "pneumonia", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 14, "start": 6, "end": 14, "concept": "Agitation", "trigger_word": "restless", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 14, "start": 6, "end": 14, "concept": "Restlessness", "trigger_word": "restless", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 19, "start": 45, "end": 49, "concept": "Pain", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 24, "start": 11, "end": 13, "concept": "Actinic cheilitis", "trigger_word": "AC", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 25, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Pneumonia", "trigger_word": "Pneumonia", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 30, "start": 3, "end": 16, "concept": "Heart failure", "trigger_word": "Heart failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 30, "start": 18, "end": 21, "concept": "Congestive heart failure", "trigger_word": "CHF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 37, "start": 16, "end": 18, "concept": "Actinic cheilitis", "trigger_word": "AC", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 44, "start": 17, "end": 27, "concept": "Acute onset pain", "trigger_word": "acute pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 44, "start": 29, "end": 41, "concept": "Chronic pain", "trigger_word": "chronic pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 13}, {"num_sents": 46, "start": 40, "end": 49, "concept": "Back Pain", "trigger_word": "back pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 14}, {"num_sents": 58, "start": 28, "end": 36, "concept": "Coughing", "trigger_word": "coughing", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 15}, {"num_sents": 60, "start": 10, "end": 13, "concept": "Butting", "trigger_word": "but", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 16}], "row_id": 366962, "cg_id": 15225, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 151, "subject_id": 16975, "hadm_id": 146690}
