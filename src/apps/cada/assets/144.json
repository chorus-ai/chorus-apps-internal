{"text": "45 year old woman admitted to T/SICU from the OR following a\n   transsternal T4 vertebrectomy and mass removal. Pt. with alcoholic\n   cirrhosis and had 5L blood loss in OR.\n   PMH:\n   Hx DM2, CRI, ETOH abuse, pancreatitis, and cirrhosis, depression who\n   was admitted on [**2130-4-27**]  with new acute low back pain w/ bilateral leg\n   spasms, and was found on CTA to have T4 vertebral body destruction. Pt\n   was seen on [**2130-4-22**] at OSH for atypical chest pain with negative cardiac\n   eval. One day later after discharge, she re-presented to OSH with\n   mid-low back pain. Pt was also recently discharged from [**Hospital 1711**]\n   Hospital ([**Date range (2) 6007**]?) for ETOH detoxification.  Attempts to biopsy\n   area and resect using posterior approach were abandoned as pt. could\n   not tolerate prone position.\n   T4 vertebrectomy via transsternal approach\n   Assessment:\n   Long OR course with large blood loss.  Arrived sedated on propofol and\n   requiring neo for BP maintenance. Two right sided chest tubes with\n   large sanginous output to water seal. Multiple areas of ecchymosis\n   especially on back and perineal area. Last hct 35, INR 1.6.  Sternal/R\n   thoracotomy incision closed with dermabond, open to air. Intubated.\n   Lumbar drain in place without drainage. Lactate 2.9.\n   Action:\n   Q 1-2 hour neuro checks done, thoracic CT obtain, CXR X 2 done,\n   frequent lab draws, 2 units prbc, 2 units ffp, bag of platelets given.\n   Q 1 hour chest tube output recorded and patency ensured.  Lumbar drain\n   positioned in effort to obtain 15cc CSF output q 1 hour. Dr [**First Name (STitle) **]\n   assessed drain patency at 01:00.\n   Response:\n   Awakes to name while on low dose propofol, follows commands but gets\n   agitated and clamps on endotracheal tube. Follow commands readily with\n   arms, wiggles l toes and withdraws R leg to pain. CT output slowed,\n   continued to require low dose neo. Initially lumbar drain did not\n   drain, now with 12cc/hr when level at -5 cm below shoulder.\n   Plan:\n   Continue to monitor neuro status, ct output, labs.  Consider weaning to\n   extubation when stabilized.\n   Coagulopathy ..pt with alcohol cirrhosis\n   Assessment:\n   Large abdomen with ascities.  Hct 22, INR 1.6, platelets down to 80\n   multiple areas of ecchymosis and oozing from central lines. Large CT\n   output\n   Action:\n   PRBCs X 2 given, 2 units ffp, 1 bag of platelets. Frequent lab\n   monitoring.\n   Response:\n   Decrease in CT output, less oozing from central lines, stabilizing\n   hemodynamics\n   Plan:\n   Continue to monitor closely.\n   Pain control (acute pain, chronic pain)\n   Assessment:\n   Large thoracic/sternal incision. Initially on propofol only.  Was\n   previously on neurontin and Dilaudid for back pain.\n   Action:\n   Pain assessment q 2-4 hours, fentanyl iv as well as repositioning for\n   pain reduction\n   Response:\n   Pt. nods that pain is acceptable. Because of intubated status, unable\n   to use pain scale.\n   Plan:\n   Continue frequent assessment. Judicious use of narcotics as indicated\n   combined with positioning techniques. Restart adjunctive pain measures\n   today (lidocaine patch and neurontin). When extubated, consider\n   switching to PCA medication.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 3, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1623038", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 3, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Liver Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0023890", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 16, "end": 26, "concept": "Alcohol abuse", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0085762", "trigger_word": "ETOH abuse", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 28, "end": 40, "concept": "Pancreatitis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0030305", "trigger_word": "pancreatitis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 46, "end": 55, "concept": "Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1623038", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 46, "end": 55, "concept": "Liver Cirrhosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0023890", "trigger_word": "cirrhosis", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 57, "end": 67, "concept": "Depressed mood", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0344315", "trigger_word": "depression", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 57, "end": 67, "concept": "Depressive disorder", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0011581", "trigger_word": "depression", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 57, "end": 67, "concept": "Mental Depression", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0011570", "trigger_word": "depression", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 30, "start": 3, "end": 11, "concept": "Agitation", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0085631", "trigger_word": "agitated", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 50, "start": 17, "end": 27, "concept": "Acute onset pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0184567", "trigger_word": "acute pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 50, "start": 29, "end": 41, "concept": "Chronic pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0150055", "trigger_word": "chronic pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 53, "start": 44, "end": 53, "concept": "Back Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0004604", "trigger_word": "back pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 56, "start": 3, "end": 7, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 13}, {"num_sents": 58, "start": 7, "end": 11, "concept": "Dentatorubral-Pallidoluysian Atrophy", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0751781", "trigger_word": "nods", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 14}, {"num_sents": 58, "start": 17, "end": 21, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 15}, {"num_sents": 62, "start": 60, "end": 64, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 3, "concept_id": 16}], "row_id": 671473, "cg_id": 19710, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 144, "subject_id": 62795, "hadm_id": 173748}
