{"text": "The pt is a 76 y/o F with multiple medical problems who presented to an\n   outside hospital in early [**Month (only) 2965**] with increasing abdominal girth for\n   5-days, followed by increasing right-upper quadrant pain. No previous\n   history of ascities. Abdominal CT scan demonstrated massive asictes and\n   bilateral pleural effusions. Further workup per report revealed normal\n   TTE and nl abd US. Ultrasound guided biopsy did not show cirrhosis,\n   fatty infiltration, or iron deposition. Diagnostic paracentesis\n   negative for SBP, with serum-ascites albumin gradient of 1.1 suggestive\n   of portal hypertension. She also underwent large volume (unclear\n   amount) therapeutic paracentesis per discharge summary, but had\n   reaccumulation of fluid. She was started on diuretics for her ascites,\n   but noted to develop acute renal failure necessitating nephrology\n   consult. Diuretic dose was reduced given concern for pre-renal azotemia\n   secondary to poor PO intake and diuretics. During her hospital course,\n   she had been afebrile, although appeared to have a leukocytosis to 15.3\n   with 22% bands on CBC differential on the day of discharge. INR was\n   also noted to be supratherapeutic at 7.3 and her warfarin was held. She\n   was also reported to have foul-smelling urine and dysuria and was\n   started on levofloxacin on the day of discharge. She was transferred to\n   [**Hospital1 1**] for further evaluation and management of the above issues.\n   .\n   On arrival to [**Hospital1 1**] the patient, was empirically started on ceftriaxone\n   and cipro for empiric SBP treatment as HCP unable to be contact[**Name (NI) **] to\n   obtain consent for paracentesis. ARF worsened to Cr of 4.1, renal\n   consult felt most c/w ATN. She was given a volume trial with albumin\n   and a total of 3L NS today. This evening the patient developed atrial\n   fibrillation with rate to 150s with acute change in MS. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) **]\n   negative. BP stable in 130s. Initally with mild resp distress with sat\n   94% on RA but uncomfortable appearing. Pt began to complain of dyspnea\n   and was placed on FM and given neb and 20IV lasix with 50cc urine\n   output over 1hr. SL ntg. Sating 100% on 4L. Given 5mg IV lopressor for\n   HR 130s followed by additional 5mg IV. CXR with volume overload. Given\n   40mg IV lasix with minimal urine output. Pt now transferred to MICU for\n   resp distress and oliguria. Per nightfloat upon discussion with HCP\n   this evening, code status changed from DNR/DNI at OSH to Full Code now.\n   .\n   On arrival to MICU, the patient was resting more comfortably with\n   decreased work of breathing, sating 95% on 2L. Alert but not oriented.\n   CODE: At OSH pt was made DNR DNI: Attorney and Healthcare proxy [**Name (NI) **]\n   [**Name (NI) 3581**]. Resident spoke directly with Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 3581**] today, who expressed\n   surprise that patient was DNR DNI at OSH. Ms. [**Name13 (STitle) 3581**] noted, however,\n   that she was lucid enough at the OSH to have been able to communicate\n   her true intentions and wishes. Given that OSH documentation indicates\n   patient has been DNR DNI (recorded in the records presented on transfer\n   and written on the pt's OSH wrist band),  conclusion of conversation\n   was that patient would remain DNR DNI on evening of admission, and that\n   the HCP would need come-in to the hospital to re-assess. After\n   discussion following resp distress this pm code status was reversed to\n   Full Code\n   .\n   # DISPO: Pending above evaluation.\n   .\n   Renal failure, acute (Acute renal failure, ARF)\n   Assessment:\n   pt with foley cath arrived to unit with 60cc clear yellow urine.
