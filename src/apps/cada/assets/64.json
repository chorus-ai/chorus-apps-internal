{"text": "68 year old gentleman was transferred to [**Hospital1 1**] (scheduled for floor\n   admission) from [**Hospital 11374**] Community Hospital at the request of his\n   family for ongoing pneumonia.  During the Medivac (per flow sheet):\n   patient ambulatory prior to flight.  During the flight he was in Afib,\n   satting 96-100% on 3L NC.  Never hypotensive or tachycardic. BS varied\n   from 81-441 (pre/post dextrose administration).  Patient became\n   confused ~1615. His rate increased to 110 ~ 1700, labeled as ? for\n   which he received 100mg Lidocaine, presumably IV just prior to arrival\n   at [**Hospital1 1**].  After deplaning from a medivac flight, the patient became\n   unresponsive and was transferred to the [**Hospital1 1**] emergency room.\n   In the ED, vital signs were initially: 96.9 69 180/84 12 100% NRB.\n   Patient was intubated for airway protection given unresponsiveness. He\n   was given Vanc/Zosyn for HAP vs. abdominal process. BS in the 70s,\n   given D50 without change in mental status.  Transferred to the MICU.\n   On arrival to the floor, the patient is not responsive to voice or\n   sternal rub.  His family is present and confirm the hospital course.\n   Per all reports, he was independent at home and still working but\n   \"slowing down\" recently with weight loss, several recent\n   hospitalizations for pneumonia.  His rapid change in status today was\n   unexpected and not at all resembling his recent hospital course.\n   Brief Hospital Course per included records:\n   The patient was seen in the [**Hospital 11374**] Community Hospital ED on [**2-20**]\n   for confusion.  He was started on levaquin and ceftriaxone then\n   admitted to the floor for PNA. Never hypotensive in their ED.  Some\n   confusion but no unresponsiveness for which an LP was performed. Cards,\n   ID, Endocrine consulted with the major change being abx switced to\n   Zosyn for PNA.\n   Progress notes are only available after [**2-25**], but the patent failed a\n   video swallow and was thought to have erosive esophagitis and a G-tube\n   was placed on ?[**2-26**].  The patient was awake and oriented during the\n   hospital course. He was started on metoprolol--> diltiazem and coumadin\n   for Afib.  On [**2-28**], he was found to be in heart failure based on CXR\n   findings and started on bolus lasix, but exam not consistent with CHF.\n   Digoxin was added for rate control.  On [**3-2**], a ? of LUE DVT was raised\n   as was a tricuspid valve vegitation.\n   Altered mental status (not Delirium)\n   Assessment:\n   Received patient on 20mcg of propofol. Arouses to voice, will opens\n   eyes and follow commands. Moving all extremities. No signs of pain or\n   discomfort. Soft wrist restraints for safety of lines and tubes. Head\n   CT negative.\n   Action:\n   Monitoring mental status. Weaning propofol to off for daily wake-ups.\n   2pt soft wrist restraints.\n   Response:\n   No changes in neuro exam.\n   Plan:\n   Daily wake-ups, maintain on minimal dose of propofol as tolerated.\n   ECHO to evaluate for clot/vegetation.\n   F/u on OSH CSF cultures.\n   Pneumonia, aspiration\n   Assessment:\n   Received intubated on vent on settings A/C 450x14 40% +5peep. Rarely\n   overbreathing vent. Sats 100%. Lung sounds clear with diminished left\n   base. Comfortably sedated on propofol. Urine output ~95cc/hr s/p fluid\n   bolus. Afebrile. Abd CT with possible vegetation vs clot vs neoplasm on\n   TR.\n   Action:\n   Maintained on current vent settings. Vanco and zosyn.\n   Response:\n   RR 14-25 with sats 98-100%. Lung sounds clearer. Suctioned for thick,\n   yellow sputum. Chest CT with no PE, has LUL PNA, b/l pleural effusions\n   (R>L). Torso concerning for ?hepatic lesion (?neoplasm). Urine output\n   improved 70-80cc/hr. Temp up to 99.5 now trending back to 97.5 off\n   blanket. WBC 8.1.\n   Plan:\n   Wean vent as tolerated.\n   Continue antibiotics as ordered.\n   F/u on blood and sputum cultures.\n   F/u with final reads of CT\n   Monitor urine output.\n   Monitor Temperature.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 3, "start": 22, "end": 31, "concept": "Pneumonia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0032285", "trigger_word": "pneumonia", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 4, "start": 61, "end": 64, "concept": "Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0043194", "trigger_word": "was", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 4, "start": 68, "end": 72, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0004238", "trigger_word": "Afib", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 7, "start": 3, "end": 11, "concept": "Confusion", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0009676", "trigger_word": "confused", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 19, "start": 24, "end": 33, "concept": "Pneumonia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0032285", "trigger_word": "pneumonia", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 23, "start": 7, "end": 16, "concept": "Confusion", "trigger_word": "confusion", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 25, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Confusion", "trigger_word": "confusion", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 25, "start": 68, "end": 73, "concept": "Sex Differentiation Disorders", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C2930619", "trigger_word": "Cards", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 26, "start": 3, "end": 5, "concept": "Communicable Diseases", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0009450", "trigger_word": "ID", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 32, "start": 7, "end": 11, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0004238", "trigger_word": "Afib", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 32, "start": 51, "end": 64, "concept": "Congestive heart failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0018802", "trigger_word": "heart failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 32, "start": 51, "end": 64, "concept": "Heart failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0018801", "trigger_word": "heart failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 33, "start": 69, "end": 72, "concept": "Congestive heart failure", "trigger_word": "CHF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 34, "start": 65, "end": 68, "concept": "Deep Vein Thrombosis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0149871", "trigger_word": "DVT", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 13}, {"num_sents": 36, "start": 3, "end": 24, "concept": "Abnormal mental state", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0278061", "trigger_word": "Altered mental status", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 14}, {"num_sents": 36, "start": 30, "end": 38, "concept": "Delirium", "semtypes": ["mobd"], "cui": "C0011206", "trigger_word": "Delirium", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 15}, {"num_sents": 40, "start": 3, "end": 13, "concept": "Discomfort", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C2364135", "trigger_word": "discomfort", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 16}, {"num_sents": 51, "start": 3, "end": 12, "concept": "Pneumonia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0032285", "trigger_word": "Pneumonia", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 17}, {"num_sents": 62, "start": 56, "end": 73, "concept": "Pleural effusion disorder", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0032227", "trigger_word": "pleural effusions", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 18}], "row_id": 624944, "cg_id": 16302, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Physician", "description": "Physician Resident Admission Note", "index": 64, "subject_id": 86323, "hadm_id": 115774}
