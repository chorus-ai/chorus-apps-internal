{"text": "Unit No:  [**Numeric Identifier 4669**]\nAdmission Date: [**2167-8-11**]\nDischarge Date: [**2167-8-15**]\nDate of Birth:  [**2091-6-8**]\nSex:  M\nService:\n\n\nHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 76-year-old man\nwith a history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and coronary\nartery disease (status post inferior myocardial infarction\nwith ventricular fibrillation arrest in [**2156**]) who has done\nwell with only six episodes of exertional angina until then.\n\nThree days ago, the patient woke up at 3:00 a.m. with severe\nmidsternal chest pain radiating to the left arm.  It was\nsimilar to the symptoms of his prior myocardial infarction.\nIt was not associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or\nshortness of breath.\n\nThe patient presented to [**Hospital **] Hospital within one half\nhour of the onset of the pain where he was treated with\nsublingual nitroglycerin, oxygen, morphine, and heparin.  The\npatient became pain free and remained so for the remainder of\nhis hospitalization.  The patient ruled in for a myocardial\ninfarction with a positive troponin level of 2.87 and a\ncreatine kinase of 426.\n\nCardiac catheterization performed on the day prior to\nadmission at [**Hospital **] Hospital demonstrated a small LIMA,\ntotal occlusion of the SVG to OM,  and diseased segments of\nthe SVG to diagonal to obtuse marginal.  The ejection\nfraction was normal.  The LV end-diastolic pressure was 19,\nright atrial pressure was 13, and pulmonary artery pressure\n33/10.\n\nThe patient was transported to [**Hospital1 188**] on the day of admission where he underwent stenting of\nthe saphenous vein graft to diagonal and obtuse marginal with\na PercuSurge distal protection device.  The patient\nexperienced his typical anginal symptoms during the procedure\nand for approximately one hour status post procedure.\n\nThe patient denied a history of shortness of breath, dyspnea\non exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea,\npalpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, or presyncope.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\n1. Coronary artery disease; status post myocardial infarction\n   times two.\n2. Hypertension.\n3. Dyslipidemia.\n4. Osteoarthritis.\n5. Question of sleep apnea.\n6. Lower extremity claudication.\n\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Vital signs revealed\nhis blood pressure was 100 to 110/60, his heart rate was 40\nto 50 (without ectopy), and he was saturating 100 percent on\nroom air.  Neck revealed no jugular venous distention.  The\nlungs were clear to auscultation anteriorly.  Heart revealed\ndistant first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  A [**1-1**]\napical murmur.  There was a sternotomy scar.  A right groin\narterial sheath in situ with positive ecchymosis.  No\nhematoma or ooze.  The distal pulses were intact on\nextremities.  The feet were cool bilaterally.  There were no\nedema.  There was a left lower extremity saphenous vein graft\nharvest scar.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  White blood\ncell count was 7.2, his hematocrit was 40.7, and his\nplatelets were 187.  His blood urea nitrogen was 20 and his\ncreatinine was 1.1.  Cholesterol was 154, his high-density\nlipoprotein was 30, and his low-density lipoprotein was 90.\n\nPERTINENT RADIOLOGY-IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed\nsinus bradycardia with a rate in the 50s.  There were small Q\nwaves and ST-T wave sloping in III and aVF.  There was a 1-mm\nST segment depressions in V2 through V4.\n\nSUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  As noted above, the patient was\ntaken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory for stenting\nprocedure.  He was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization\nLaboratory.  The patient complained of persistent chest pain\nwhere he had three stents placed.  Then the patient dropped\nhis blood pressure significantly in the SVG to first diagonal\nto first obtuse marginal jump graft  90's with prominent ST\ndepressions in V1, two hepicoat stents mid and distally, one\ncypher in the ostium.  At this time a thrombus was discovered\nat the site of intervention and distal stent was occluded.\n\nPost procedure, the patient developed recurrent angina with\nmore prominent ST depressions in V1 through V4, ST elevations\nin I and aVL, with a decrease in blood pressures to systolics\nin the 90s when the nitroglycerin drip was increased.\n\nThe patient was taken back to the Cardiac Catheterization\nLaboratory where a thrombus was found at the site of\nintervention, and the distal stent was occluded.  The patient\nunderwent angioplasty with two stent placements distally and\nadministration of Integrelin, clopidogrel, and intracoronary\nTPA.  An intraaortic balloon pump was placed to maximize\ncoronary blood flow.\n\nAfter this procedure the patient did well and was able to be\nweaned off the balloon pump.  The patient was continued on\naspirin, beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, Plavix, and statin.\nThe patient did develop a moderate retroperitoneal hematoma\nrequiring a transfusion of blood, though this was stable.  In\naddition, the patient had episodes of nonsustained\nventricular tachycardia for which he will follow up with\nElectrophysiology for further risk stratification.\n\nCONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Good.\n\nDISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:\n1. Coronary artery disease; status post non-ST-elevation\n   myocardial infarction with subacute stent occlusion.\n2. Retroperitoneal hematoma.\n\n\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:\n1. Aspirin 325 mg by mouth once per day.\n2. Clopidogrel 75 mg by mouth once per day.\n3. Nitroglycerin 0.3-mg sublingual tablets as needed.\n4. Lisinopril 10 mg by mouth once per day.\n5. Pantoprazole 40 mg by mouth once per day.\n6. Atorvastatin 40 mg by mouth once per day.\n7. Multivitamin by mouth every day.\n8. Metoprolol 12.5 mg by mouth twice per day.\n\n\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS-FOLLOWUP:\n1. The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] (his\n   cardiologist) who will arrange for signal-averaged EKG and\n   exercise T wave alternate study.\n2. The patient was to follow up with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] when\n   these studies are completed.\n3. The patient was instructed to follow up with his primary\n   care doctor (Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1968**]) within one month.\n\n\n\n\n
