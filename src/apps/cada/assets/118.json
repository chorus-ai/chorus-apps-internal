The morning after admission on [**9-1**]\n   pt was noted to be hypotensive & tachycardic with low uop & an elevated\n   BUN and creatinine of 2. [**Month/Year (2) **] & pelvic CT w/ contrast obtained revealing\n   large amts of free air & fluid in [**Month/Year (2) **], as well as contrast within the\n   [**Month/Year (2) **] cavity.

Underwent evac of ascites,\n   exploration, and over seven patch repair of the gastric ulcer with\n   placement of a JP drain. Required aggressive fluid resuscitation,\n   placed on levo & neo for BP support, and propofol gtt & prn ativan for\n   sedation/ETOH withdrawal.

Transferred to [**Hospital1 **] for further mgmt. Pt sedated on\n   propofol 30-50 mcg/kg/min. Pt very sedated, slow to arouse. Off\n   propofol for neuro exams.  Fentanyl as needed for pain.
