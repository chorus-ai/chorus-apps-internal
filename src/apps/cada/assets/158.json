She also received prednisone,\nerythromycin, Percocet, Lactulose and Tylenol that day.\n\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  1. Type 1 diabetes diagnosed at age\nseven.  She is fine from retinopathy.  2. End-stage renal\ndisease on peritoneal dialysis.  3. Coronary artery disease.\n4. Neuropathy.  5. History of anemia on Epogen.  6. Acute\nrheumatic fever diagnosed on the last admission.  7.\nQuestionable transient ischemic attack about 15 years ago.\n8. History of hypertension.\n\nALLERGIES:  Keflex causes swelling and itching.  Penicillin\ncauses swelling and itching.\n\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  1. Aspirin.  2. Prednisone.  3.\nErythromycin.  4.

She drinks\nalcohol socially; no tobacco or drugs.\n\nFAMILY HISTORY:  There is a family history of diabetes.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In the emergency room on initial\nphysical examination her blood pressure was 97/60, oxygen\nsaturation 96% on room air, temperature 98.2, respiratory\nrate 17.  In general she was in no acute distress, alert and\noriented.  HEENT:  Behind the left tympanic membrane she had\na small amount of fluid and the right tympanic membrane was\nclear and normal.  Neck:  Supple with no lymphadenopathy.\nTender to palpation over the trapezoid muscle.\nCardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs,\ngallops, or rubs.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.\nAbdomen:  Positive bowel sounds, mildly distended, nontender.\nExtremities:  Warm, 3+ edema to the knee.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  On initial laboratory studies she had a\nsodium of 127, potassium 3.6, chloride 86, bicarbonate 24,\nBUN 72, creatinine 9.4, which is about her baseline.  Glucose\n196.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient's beta blocker, Lopressor, was\nheld.  Her blood pressure remained stable throughout the\nremainder of her hospitalization.  On the first morning of\nher hospitalization, [**2125-8-19**], she developed a leukocytosis\nwith a left shift, eight bands.  Blood cultures, urine\ncultures and sputum cultures were obtained and antibiotics\nwere not initially started.  The patient was not febrile and\nhad no symptoms of infection.\n\nOn [**2125-8-20**] the patient's urine culture showed 10,000 to\n100,000 Gram-negative rods.  It grew out Klebsiella, which\nwas pansensitive.  She was started on levofloxacin.  The\npatient was also followed by rheumatology throughout her\nhospitalization.  Her ESR, CRP were also repeated.  CRP had\ndecreased from previous admission.  ESR had increased from 65\nto 122.  She also had a repeat echocardiogram which showed\ndecreasing small effusion.  Rheumatology suggested prednisone\ntaper to decrease by 5 mg every day.\n\nThe patient was also seen by cardiology.  She was ruled out\nfor an myocardial infarction and they suggested holding her\nLopressor for the hypotension.  The nephrology service\nsuggested that her Lopressor not be restarted until she was\nback to her baseline dry weight from dialysis.\n\nThe patient was also closely followed by [**Last Name (un) **] and suggested\nthat she continue her sliding scale as the prednisone was\nincreasing her insulin requirements.\n\nThe patient's blood pressure remained stable through\n[**2125-8-21**].  She was discharged to home in stable condition.\n\nDISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Hypotension likely secondary to beta\nblocker, Lopressor, that was started on the previous\nadmission and possibly hypovolemia.\n\nDISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to follow up with\nnephrology, Dr.[**Doctor Last Name 4849**] in one week; cardiology with Dr.\n[**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week; with her primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **].\n[**Last Name (STitle) 174**], in the next two weeks; infectious disease at\n[**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**], call to make follow-up appointment; and her\nrheumatologisst in one to two days.
