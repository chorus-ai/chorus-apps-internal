{"text": "Mr. [**Known lastname 8498**] is a 73 yoM on HD-anuric, h/o AFib not currently on\n   coumadin (though is on at home), who is being transferred from the\n   neurology service for respiratory distress and hypoxia.  He was\n   admitted on [**2191-8-12**] after a fall resulting in acute on chronic SDH on\n   the left; his course is complicated by seizure and he has been started\n   on fosphenytoin & phenytoin.\n   .\n   This evening he was noted to be in acute respiratory distress with\n   desats to the low to mid 90's on 3LNC (reportedly desatting to the mid\n   70's on room air; has had a variable O2 requirement since being\n   admitted).  His blood pressure dropped to the 70's systolic and was\n   responsive to the 80's and then 100's after a 250 cc NS bolus.  he was\n   febrile to 101.9,concern was aspiration event,pt has been on on\n   vanco/genta for the given recent fevers,with neg cultures\n    he was briefly in MICU green on [**8-17**] - [**8-18**] for fevers and hypotension\n   to the 70's.\n   Respiratory failure, acute (not ARDS/[**Doctor Last Name 2**])\n   Assessment:\n   Remains vented on ACx18/500/40%/5.  LS diminished at bases.  Sats\n   94-97% Pt sedated on fentanyl and versed drips.  He is able to follow\n   commands inconsistently.\n   Action:\n   Suctioned for thick copious secretions q 2-4 hours.\n   Response:\n   No change. Pt maintaining good saturation\n   Plan:\n   Wean vent as tolerated.  CXR in am.  ? a line placement if long term\n   ventilation needed.\n   Fever, unknown origin (FUO, Hyperthermia, Pyrexia)\n   Assessment:\n   TMAX  102.4 axillary.\n   Action:\n   Rectal Tylenol given.  Cooling blanket placed on pt.  Pt started on\n   cefepime.\n   Response:\n   Temperature decreased to 97.9.  Awaiting culture data.\n   Plan:\n   Administer Tylenol as needed.  Continue to monitor\n   Hypotension (not Shock)\n   Assessment:\n   HR 90\ns SR.  BP 98-137/29-39.  Pt remains on levophed drip to maintain\n   systolic BPs >100.  Pt continues to have large residual from NGT so pt\n   remains NPO.  Elevated FS despite being NPO. Pt is HD dependent.  He\n   currently does not have access.\n   Action:\n   Attempted to wean levophed.  Able to decrease dose to .06mcgs/kg/min\n   from .12mcgs/kg/min.\n   Response:\n   Systolic goal >100.\n   Plan:\n   Wean levophed to off if tolerated.  Dialysis tomorrow. Pt will need\n   access placed.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 1, "start": 60, "end": 64, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0004238", "trigger_word": "AFib", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 3, "start": 25, "end": 45, "concept": "Respiratory distress", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0476273", "trigger_word": "respiratory distress", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 5, "start": 42, "end": 49, "concept": "Seizures", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0036572", "trigger_word": "seizure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 8, "start": 38, "end": 64, "concept": "Acute respiratory distress", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0748355", "trigger_word": "acute respiratory distress", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 12, "start": 56, "end": 58, "concept": "Nuclear non-senile cataract", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1112705", "trigger_word": "NS", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 13, "start": 3, "end": 10, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "febrile", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 14, "start": 36, "end": 42, "concept": "Fever", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0015967", "trigger_word": "fevers", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 15, "start": 64, "end": 70, "concept": "Fever", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0015967", "trigger_word": "fevers", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 17, "start": 3, "end": 22, "concept": "Respiratory Failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1145670", "trigger_word": "Respiratory failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 29, "start": 3, "end": 8, "concept": "Fever", "trigger_word": "Fever", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 29, "start": 26, "end": 29, "concept": "Fever of Unknown Origin", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0015970", "trigger_word": "FUO", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}], "row_id": 598031, "cg_id": 15025, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Physician", "description": "Physician Resident Admission Note", "index": 28, "subject_id": 54229, "hadm_id": 165594}
