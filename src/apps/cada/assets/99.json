{"text": "76 year old male with history of AS/AI and bilateral total hip\n   replacements w. recurrent pain who underwent left hip surgery at NEBH\n   on [**3-8**], however post-op course was c/b SSCP and subsequent NSTEMI.\n   Transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for MI care, pain-free on heparin gtt prior to\n   cath on [**3-12**]. Cath showed- 3 VD, severe AS and severe pulmonary arterial\n   HTN and heart failure. Cardiac surgery consulted for CABG/AVR. Remains\n   in CCU post-cath and pre- op for plavix washout.\n   Myocardial infarction, acute (AMI, STEMI, NSTEMI)\n   Assessment:\n   NSTEMI 48 hours ago as above at OSH in post-op setting. s/p cath [**3-12**]\n   which showed: 3 VD, PA HTN, diastolic heart failure as well as\n   pre-procedure AFib. Now in NSR rate 70-90 w/ frequent multifocal\n   PVC\ns/bigeminy. SBP range 99-120s /50s. Right groin dressing post-cath\n   remains c,d& i. pedal pulses easily palpable, remains CP free. Heparin\n   off since cath lab confirmed with CCU team.\n   Action:\n    Monitored right groin site and pulses post-cath. Monitored for pain.\n   Followed lab results. Monitored I&O in setting of diastolic heart\n   failure. Given 20 meq po K+ for afternoon level of 3.8. Given 2 gm MG+\n   for afternoon level of 1.8. CSurg consulted by CCU team for CABG/AVR.\n   Response:\n   Groin site remained stable and unchanged overnight w/ no heme/ooze or\n   pain. Pulses easily palpable. AM HCT on [**3-13**]- 25.5 (same as\n   post-transfusion HCT level from prior shift). Platelets WNL post-cath.\n   Pt. requesting large volumes water/ice overnight, which were given in\n   limited quantities given pt.\ns high filling pressures and diuresis in\n   cath lab. Currently is\n 200 cc\ns since midnight. Continues to deny CP.\n   Heparin gtt remains off per team despite known 3 VD w. rationale that\n   pt had low HCT since hip surgery and is 48 hours from the onset of his\n   NSTEMI. AM K+ 4.2 and Mg+ 2.5.\n   Plan:\n   Continue to monitor groin site and pedal pulses. Follow labs as\n   ordered. Monitor for any s/s CP. Hold plavix [**3-13**] for wash-out pre-op.\n   Carotid u/s ordered as well as cardiac echo for pre-op workup. Provide\n   emotional support to patient.\n   [**Last Name **] Problem\n s/p l hip replacment\n   Assessment:\n   s/p left hip surgery on [**3-8**] at OSH. Left hip dressing c,d, and intact\n   although not dated (changed on [**3-12**] by ortho team per report), no\n   drainage seen, although area of ecchymosis seen beyond dressing\n   extending towards patients left buttock. Mild pain with turning\n   although full ROM to pt\ns left foot\n patient continues to deny offer\n   of pain medication & slept in naps overnight.\n   Action:\n   Monitored dressing and for c/o worsening pain or loss of ROM.\n   Response:\n   Dressing remains intact and area of ecchymosis unchanged. Continues to\n   have ROM in left ankle, also continues to decline offer of pain\n   medication.\n   Plan:\n   Continue to monitor dressing, caution w/ turning and continue\n   pain-management as needed.\n   Add: post-cath renal function slightly worse this am ([**3-13**]) per labs-\n   CR 1.3 (1.2) and BUN 30 (23).\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 2, "start": 29, "end": 33, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 3, "start": 68, "end": 74, "concept": "Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C4255010", "trigger_word": "NSTEMI", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 6, "start": 3, "end": 6, "concept": "Hypertensive disease", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0020538", "trigger_word": "HTN", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 6, "start": 11, "end": 24, "concept": "Congestive heart failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0018802", "trigger_word": "heart failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 6, "start": 11, "end": 24, "concept": "Heart failure", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0018801", "trigger_word": "heart failure", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 8, "start": 45, "end": 51, "concept": "Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C4255010", "trigger_word": "NSTEMI", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 10, "start": 3, "end": 9, "concept": "Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C4255010", "trigger_word": "NSTEMI", "occ": 3, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 11, "start": 26, "end": 29, "concept": "Hypertensive disease", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0020538", "trigger_word": "HTN", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 12, "start": 17, "end": 21, "concept": "Atrial Fibrillation", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0004238", "trigger_word": "AFib", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 18, "start": 67, "end": 71, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 24, "start": 3, "end": 7, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 3, "concept_id": 10}, {"num_sents": 34, "start": 3, "end": 9, "concept": "Non-ST Elevated Myocardial Infarction", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C4255010", "trigger_word": "NSTEMI", "occ": 4, "concept_id": 11}, {"num_sents": 50, "start": 6, "end": 10, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 4, "concept_id": 12}, {"num_sents": 55, "start": 62, "end": 66, "concept": "Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0030193", "trigger_word": "pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 13}], "row_id": 446147, "cg_id": 14214, "caregiver": {"label": "RN", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 99, "subject_id": 63000, "hadm_id": 177882}
