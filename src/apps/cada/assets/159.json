She attributed this\nto humidity.  She does note that she was eating more salt that\nusual given dining out.  Also noticed intermittent heart\npalpitations.  She went to the ER on [**2144-8-3**] with SOB.  She was\nseen by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in consult and given improvement of SOB\nafter Lasix, advised that she can be discharged home.  Patient\nalso saw Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**] in clinic on [**8-6**] at which time she was\nnot SOB, lungs were clear and she did not have any lower\nextremity edema.  At that time, several medication changes were\nmade.  She was started on Coumadin, Metoprolol was discontinued\nand she was started instead on Carvedilol 6.25mg [**Hospital1 **].  Patient\ninstead self titrated the metoprolol to 50mg daily and had been\ntaking carvedilol 3.12 daily.\n.\nOn Saturday [**8-8**], she again developed SOB with minimal exertion\nand with lying flat.  Breathing better with sitting upright.\nPositive PND.  This morning, noticed swelling in her ankles. Has\nalso had intermittent palpitations.  Denies any chest pain.\nlightheadedness.  Although patient states she has never had\nsymptoms of SOB with exertion, OMR note documents that she\nreported some SOB with walking up the stairs in 4/[**2143**].\n.\nIn the ED, initial vitals were 96.8 54 128/85 32 90s%.  Patient\nwas placed on 3L NC, O2 sats remained stable, no SOB at rest,\nsome with getting out of bed.

Cardiomegaly is moderate to severe, unchanged.\nMediastinum is unremarkable. No pneumothorax is seen. Small\namount of pleural effusion is noted most likely on the right.\n\nECG [**8-11**]: Atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response.\nLeft bundle-branch block with a single narrowly conducted QRS\ncomplex. The axis is right inferior. Since previous tracing the\nsingle narrow complex beat is new. Despite a more rapid\nventricular response, the axis is the same. One should verify\nthat the limb leads were properly placed. Clinical correlation\nis suggested.\n.\nChest X-ray [**8-11**]:\nFINDINGS: The heart size is enlarged, apparently slightly\nincreased from\nprior study, this maybe the magnifying effect of AP projection.\nThe\nmediastinal contours again demonstrate calcified atherosclerotic\ndisease of the aortic knob. Cephalization of pulmonary\nvasculature is accompanied by interstitial edema. The lungs\ndemonstrate airspace opacity in the right\ninfrahilar region. Additionally, subtle blunting of the\nbilateral\ncostophrenic angles persist, compatible with small pleural\neffusions. Thereis no pneumothorax.\n\nIMPRESSION: Cardiomegaly with interstitial edema; right\ninfrahilar airspace\nopacity may reflect asymmetric pulmonary edema, but follow up\nradiographs may be helpful to exclude pneumonia.\n\nLabs on discharge:\n[**2144-8-22**] 06:58AM BLOOD WBC-7.5 RBC-3.69* Hgb-12.0 Hct-34.3*\nMCV-93 MCH-32.6* MCHC-35.0 RDW-14.8 Plt Ct-206\n[**2144-8-22**] 06:58AM BLOOD PT-31.7* PTT-30.9 INR(PT)-3.1*\n[**2144-8-22**] 06:58AM BLOOD Glucose-98 UreaN-10 Creat-0.5 Na-128*\nK-3.6 Cl-93* HCO3-24 AnGap-15\n[**2144-8-22**] 06:58AM BLOOD Calcium-9.5 Phos-3.6 Mg-1.8\n\nBrief Hospital Course:\nMs. [**Known lastname 7962**] is a 68 yo F with PMH of nonischemic cardiomyopathy\n(EF 25% on [**2-/2144**]), HTN, mitral valve prolapse, intermittent\nLBBB, and atrial fibrillation who was admitted for progressively\nworsening SOB for the over 3 days secondary to CHF exacerbation.\n\n.\n# Cardiac arrest: on [**8-18**], patient was successfully cardioverted\nto normal sinus rhythem. She was given a dose of dofetilide.\nLater that day it was noted that her QTc was elongated from\npreviously. That evening, she had a cardiac arrest secondary to\ntorsades de pointes and ventricular fibrillation. She was\ndefibrillated after 60 seconds and had ROSC and regained\nconsciousness. She was briefly transferred to the CCU, where her\nmagnesium and potassium were repleted and serial EKGs showed\ndecreasing QTc interval.\n\n# Acute on chronic CHF:  Patient reported history of dyspnea on\nexertion, orthopnea, PND and new onset ankle swelling.  Has\nknown history of CHF with EF 25% in 4/[**2143**]. After receiving\nLasix 40mg IV in the ER, she put out 800cc and dyspnea resolved.\n Initial history and exam consistent with a CHF exacerbation.\n[**Month (only) 116**] have baseline worsening EF as she has had such symptoms for\napproximately 2 weeks which improved with Lasix.  [**Month (only) 116**] be\nsecondary to worsening EF in combination with afib with RVR.\nPatient's beta blocker was changed on Thursday but she has been\nself titrating the medication and not receiving enough beta\nblockade.  (Was on Metoprolol XL 100, this was d/c'ed on\nThursday and started on Carvedilol 6.25 mg [**Hospital1 **].  Instead, taking\nMetoprolol 50 daily and Carvedilol 3.125 daily.) Therefore, her\nrate was not well controlled which is likely stressing the heart\nby decreasing adequate forward flow.  Initially, changed to\ncarvedilol for rate control.  On [**8-15**], carvedilol switched to\nmetoprolol and rate better controlled. Her metoprolol dose was\nadjusted again secondary to her Afib and changed up to metop\n150XL. .Patient was optimized on an oral regimen of Lasix prior\nto discharge and remained euvolemic. Patient to receive 20meqK\nreplacement on discharge as well to supplement lasix.\n.\n# Paroxysmal A-fib/RHYTHM: Patient with known history of atrial\nfibrillation.  Rate not well controlled on Carvedilol and\ndigoxin.  Patient was instead started on metoprolol with much\nbetter rate control.  Just started on Coumadin 5mg qd 5 days\nprior to admission. Patient continued anticoagulation with\ncoumadin throughout stay (dosage adjustments made per INR). PT\nhad TEE with cardiovesion [**8-18**], initiall successful then patient\ndeveloped torsades in the afternoon which responded to\nmagnesium. Shortly thereafter patient coded with Vfib, with CPR\nperformed for 1 minute, received one shock and had ROSC. Pt had\ncontinuous Mg replacement. Pt was then brought back to the floor\nin stable condition. She continued to be in Afib and had an\nincrease in her metoprolol dose for rate control. Patient was\nthen started  Amio gtt and load. She had inital attempt at BIV\nICD placement for LBBB on [**8-20**] which was unsuccessful. The\nfollowing day patient had repeat procedure and successful BIV\nICD placement. Patient remained in Afib s/p procedure, and\ncontinued her anticoagulation, and will continue PO amio and\nmetoprolol for control. Warfarin dose decreased from 6 to 5\nprior to discharge due to supratherapuetic INR 3.1. She is to\nfollow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] within the next 2 weeks, and device\nclinic on [**8-27**] for evaluation of pacemaker. Pt also will\ncomplete 6 day course of Keflex for pacemaker placement.\n\n\n# CORONARIES: No history of CAD.  LDL was 147 in 3/[**2143**].  She is\nnot on a statin because she has function limiting myalgias as a\nside effect. Pt started on ASA 81 during hospitilazation and to\ncontinue as outpatient.\n.\n.\n# Hyponatremia: Patient was hyponatremic at 129 on admission, Na\nwas lowest at 126.  Baseline in last several years (several data\npoints) has been in the mid to low 130s. Patient was\nasymptomatic, mentating well.  [**Month (only) 116**] have been secondary to\ncombination of diuretics as well as CHF exacerbation leading to\nintravascular depletion and ADH secretion.  Na improved with 1.5\nL fluid and free water restriction and stabilized. Her Na\nreturned back to her baseline upon discharge, she is to follow\nup with this in clinic.\n\n# Rash: Patient with new macular rash as of morning of admission\non lower abdomen, lower back and breasts.  Denied any new\nlotions, detergents.  Did take melatonin day prior to admission\nfor the first time.  After examination rash appeared to be\nfungal in etiology, most c/w with intertrigo. Patient placed on\ntopical miconazole with improvement in rash.\n\nTransitional Issues:\n-Will f/u in device clinic for BIV ICD\n-Pt has f/u scheduled with PCP (needs INR and Na checked)\n-Pt will get scheduled f/u with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]\n[**Name (STitle) 7964**] follow with Cardiologist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 73**]\n\nMedications on Admission:\nCarvedilol 6.25mg PO bid (actually taking [**11-24**] pill once per day\nand adding on Metoprolol XL 50)\nHydrochlothiazide 25mg PO qd\nLisinopril 40mg PO qd\nSpironolactone 25mg PO qd\nWarfarin 5mg PO qd\n\nDischarge Medications:\n1. spironolactone 25 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY\n(Daily).\n2. lisinopril 20 mg Tablet Sig: Two (2) Tablet PO HS (at\nbedtime).\n3. miconazole nitrate 2 % Powder Sig: One (1) Appl Topical [**Hospital1 **]\n(2 times a day) as needed for rash.\nDisp:*100 mL* Refills:*0*\n4. lidocaine 5 %(700 mg/patch) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Sig:\nOne (1) Adhesive Patch, Medicated Topical DAILY (Daily) as\nneeded for pain: place for 12 hours, then take off for 12 hours.\nDisp:*5 Adhesive Patch, Medicated(s)* Refills:*0*\n5. furosemide 40 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*60 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n6. aspirin 81 mg Tablet, Chewable Sig: One (1) Tablet, Chewable\nPO DAILY (Daily).\nDisp:*60 Tablet, Chewable(s)* Refills:*0*\n7. amiodarone 200 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO three times a\nday.\nDisp:*180 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n8. cephalexin 500 mg Capsule Sig: One (1) Capsule PO Q6H (every\n6 hours) for 6 days.\nDisp:*24 Capsule(s)* Refills:*0*\n9. warfarin 5 mg Tablet Sig: One (1) Tablet PO Once Daily at 4\nPM.\nDisp:*30 Tablet(s)* Refills:*0*\n10. metoprolol succinate 100 mg Tablet Extended Release 24 hr\nSig: 1.5 Tablet Extended Release 24 hrs PO once a day.\nDisp:*90 Tablet Extended Release 24 hr(s)* Refills:*0*\n11. potassium chloride 20 mEq Tablet, ER Particles/Crystals Sig:\nOne (1) Tablet, ER Particles/Crystals PO once a day.\nDisp:*60 Tablet, ER Particles/Crystals(s)* Refills:*0*\n\n\nDischarge Disposition:\nHome With Service\n\nFacility:\n[**Hospital 119**] Homecare\n\nDischarge Diagnosis:\nPrimary:\nCongestive heart failure\nAtrial fibrillation\nHypertension\nVentricular fibrillation with cardiac arrest\n\nSecondary:\nRash\nHyponatremia\n\n\nDischarge Condition:\nMental Status: Clear and coherent.\nLevel of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.\nActivity Status: Ambulatory - Independent.\n\n\nDischarge Instructions:\nDear Ms. [**Known lastname 7962**],\n.\nIt was a pleasure taking care of you during your admission to\n[**Hospital1 69**].
