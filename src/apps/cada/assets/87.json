{"text": "Pt. admitted this a.m. to MICU service from [**Hospital Ward Name 790**] 3 with hemoptysis and\n   hypoxia.  He was admitted on [**1-7**] with CHF and MSSA endocarditis,\n   being treated with diuretics and antibiotics.  Pt. developed a lower\n   body rash (?vasculitis) after receiving nafcillin and had torsades\n   after receiving moxycillin.  Other complications on the floor include\n   heart block for which he has a temporary wire (via brachial)/external\n   pacemaker, worsening renal failure with poor response to diuretics, and\n   epistaxis for which ENT packed nares with dissolving packing.\n   Early this a.m. pt. developed hemoptysis, shortness of breath and\n   hypoxia.
