He went to [**Hospital **] rehab and completed a course\n   of tobramycin (last dose ?[**2178-9-19**]).  He also had blood cx that grew\n   coag negative staph and was started on vanc on [**9-27**].  He had a\n   leukocytosis, with a WBC count of 16 that trended down to 6 on the day\n   of admission.  A urine cx grew ESBL klebsiella on [**9-30**] but he was not\n   started on antibiotics for this for unclear reasons.  During this time,\n   his metoprolol was also increased from 12.5 mg po tid to 25 mg po tid\n   on [**9-27**] for improved a. fib heart rate control.\n   .\n   On the day of admission, he was found to have a BP of 85/65 -> 60/palp\n   from a baseline in the low 100s systolic after debridement of a right\n   flank wound.  He was thought to be bacteremic and given approximately\n   1L IVF bolus with no response.

Toxicology was consulted and felt that beta blocker toxicity\n   was unlikely given absence of bradycardia.\n   .\n   A right radial a-line and left femoral line were placed for access.  A\n   CXR was performed and demonstrated infiltrate vs overload.  IVFs were\n   held after the CXR, and he was started on levophed.  Per report, a\n   bedside ECHO was also performed to eval for tamponade but was limited\n   secondary to body habitus.\n   .\n   On the floor, he was minimally responsive to verbal stimuli and began\n   having rhythmic, tooth clattering motions at the chin.
