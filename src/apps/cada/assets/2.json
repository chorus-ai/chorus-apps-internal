{"text": "[**Age over 90 **] yo F with CAD s/p CABG in [**2096**] and [**Hospital 11316**] transfered from [**Hospital1 608**] for\n   sepsis and CA w/u. The patient reports that she was treated for PNA\n   with abx and then thoracentesis two weeks ago.  Pt rpts difficulty\n   urinating and recent visit to renal MD. PCP recommended going to [**Hospital1 1074**]\n   .\n    At [**Hospital3 611**], pt was noted to be in ARF with Cr of 2.5.  She was\n   also noted to have leukocytosis. CT abdomen was performed and was\n   notable for ascites and diffuse nodular changes in periotoneal cavity\n   and on omentum suggesting carcinomatosis.  The stomach is herniated\n   into chest cavity.  Left kideny had 1.5 mm lower pole and 5.5 exophytic\n   cyst as well as 1mm nonobtracting calculus.  Right kidney had no\n   evidence of obstruction.  CT of lungs was significant for collapsed\n   left lung with left chest cavity filled with fluid, significant\n   compression and collapse of the right lower lobe with large right\n   pleural effusion.\n   She was also noted to be hypotensive to SBP of 80/50 after CT scan and\n   was bolused with fluids.  started on Vanc and Zosyn for presumed sepsis\n   and transferred to [**Hospital1 19**] for further care.\n   .\n   In the ED initial vitals were HR 67 BP 79/60 RR 23 and O2 sat: 97% on\n   3L NC.  Femoral line placed and levophed started. Admitted to [**Hospital Unit Name 1**] for\n   likely sepsis.\n   Neuro: alert and orientedx3, not a good historian on medical history.\n   Afebrile, c/o abdominal pain in ED was given Maalox w/ good effect.\n   Resp: LS diminished, O2 sat 90s on 4L NC. c/o SOB w/ exertion. O2 sat\n   dropped to 80s while sleeping and changed to FM @6L, O2 sat 95%.\n   CV: arrived on levophed gtt, 0.12mcg, BP 80s-90s. HR 60s and AV paced.\n   1L NS bolus given w/ moderate effect.\n   GI/GU: foley placed and draining small amount of yellow urine, minimal\n   increase with blous. +BS, no stool this shift.  Renal consult if no\n   improvement in UO and Creat.\n   Access: R femoral TL\n   Plan: colonoscopy and transvaginal US when stable to evaluate\n   carcinomatosis. Repeat CT scans, films did not come w/ pt form OSH.\n   Probable thoracentesis. Cont weaning levophed gtt.\n", "info": [{"num_sents": 2, "start": 3, "end": 9, "concept": "Sepsis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0243026", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 0}, {"num_sents": 2, "start": 3, "end": 9, "concept": "Septicemia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0036690", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 1}, {"num_sents": 6, "start": 50, "end": 53, "concept": "Rheumatic Fever", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0035436", "trigger_word": "ARF", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 2}, {"num_sents": 15, "start": 3, "end": 19, "concept": "Pleural effusion disorder", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0032227", "trigger_word": "pleural effusion", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 3}, {"num_sents": 17, "start": 68, "end": 74, "concept": "Sepsis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0243026", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 4}, {"num_sents": 17, "start": 68, "end": 74, "concept": "Septicemia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0036690", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 5}, {"num_sents": 22, "start": 10, "end": 16, "concept": "Sepsis", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0243026", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 6}, {"num_sents": 22, "start": 10, "end": 16, "concept": "Septicemia", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C0036690", "trigger_word": "sepsis", "occ": 2, "concept_id": 7}, {"num_sents": 24, "start": 17, "end": 31, "concept": "Abdominal Pain", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0000737", "trigger_word": "abdominal pain", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 8}, {"num_sents": 25, "start": 49, "end": 52, "concept": "Dyspnea", "semtypes": ["sosy"], "cui": "C0013404", "trigger_word": "SOB", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 9}, {"num_sents": 28, "start": 6, "end": 8, "concept": "Nuclear non-senile cataract", "semtypes": ["dsyn"], "cui": "C1112705", "trigger_word": "NS", "occ": 1, "concept_id": 10}], "row_id": 497683, "cg_id": 16009, "caregiver": {"label": "Nurs", "description": "RN"}, "category": "Nursing", "description": "Nursing Progress Note", "index": 2, "subject_id": 95555, "hadm_id": 103704}
