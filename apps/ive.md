Integrated Viewer (IVe) webapp is to develop the proposed to support visualization and interrogation of the CHoRUS dataset that will include structured EHR (OMOP), extracted concepts from clinical notes, physiological vital signs/alarms/waveform, and image data. We decompose this task into subtasks, each of which either targets a specific key feature or workflow. The development will take place first at Emory University using an equivalent local dataset, in parallel to the development of proposed CHoRUS data platform and effort of data acquisition at other sites. Throughout the development process, alpha and beta versions of IVe will be made available to at least one additional CHoRUS site for further testing. In addition, frequent demonstrations will be offered to solicit feedback and inform details of various features from the whole CHoRUS team.
