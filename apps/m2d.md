The Model Meets Data (M2D) application is a web platform designed to facilitate the publication of model cards and the benchmarking of AI/ML models. Model cards are standardized documents and scripts that provide essential information about machine learning models, including their intended use, performance metrics, and ethical considerations. By offering a centralized repository for these cards, M2D aims to enhance transparency and reproducibility in ML research. Additionally, the platform aimed to support benchmarking, allowing researchers to evaluate and compare models against established datasets and metrics.
